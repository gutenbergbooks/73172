<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is a well-grounded prejudice against
a volume which exhibits no marks of design
and which turns out to be only a fortuitous collection
of essays. It is felt that the chapters
brought together under the cover of a single book
should have something in common. When one
sees a number of subjects, each standing aloof
from the others, he predicts infelicity. It suggests
incompatibility of temper.</p>

<p>The essays brought together in “the Pardoner’s
Wallet” have at least a certain community of
interest. They treat of aspects of human nature
which, while open to friendly criticism, are excusable.
If the author sometimes touches upon the
foibles of his betters, he at least has the grace to
know that they are his betters.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap1">I</span> HAVE no plea to make for this fourteenth-century
pardoner. He was an impudent vagabond,
trafficking in damaged goods. One did
not need to be a Lollard in order to see that he
was a reprehensible character. Discerning persons
in need of relics would go to responsible
dealers where they could be assured of getting
their money’s worth. This glib-tongued fellow
peddling religious articles from door to door
lived on the credulity of untraveled country
people. He took advantage of their weaknesses.
Many a good wife would purchase a pardon she
had no need of, simply because he offered it as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
bargain. This was all wrong. We all know how
the business of indulgence-selling was overdone.
There was a general loss of confidence on the
part of the purchasing public; and at last in the
days of the too enterprising Tetzel there came a
disastrous slump. There was no market for pardons,
even of the gilt-edged varieties. Since then
very little has been doing in this line, at least
among the northern nations.</p>

<p>The pardoner richly deserved his fate. And yet
there are times when one would give something
to see the merry knave coming down the road.</p>

<p>I suppose that the nature of each individual
has its point of moral saturation. When this
point is reached, it is of no use to continue exhortation
or rebuke or any kind of didactic effort.
Even the finest quality of righteous indignation
will no longer soak in. With me the point
of moral saturation comes when I attend successively
more meetings of a reformatory and
denunciatory character than nature intended me
to profit by. If they are well distributed in point
of time, I can take in a considerable number of
good causes and earnestly reprobate an equal
number of crying evils. But there is a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
monotony of rebuke which I am sure is not beneficial
to persons of my disposition. That some
things are wrong I admit, but when I am
peremptorily ordered to believe that everything
is wrong, it arouses in me a certain obstinacy of
contradiction. I might be led to such a belief, but
I will not be driven to it. I rebel against those
censors of manners and morals who treat all human
imperfectnesses with equal rigor. To relax
even for an instant the righteous frown over the
things that are going wrong, into an indulgent
smile at the things that are not nearly so bad as
they seem, is in their eyes nothing less than compounding
a felony. If they would allow proper
intervals between protests, so that the conscience
could cool down, all would be well. But this is
just what they will not allow. The wheels must
go round without intermission until progress is
stopped by the disagreeable accident of “a hot
box.”</p>

<p>You remember after Mrs. Proudie had given
her guests a severe lesson in social ethics, the Signora
asked in her hearing,—</p>

<p>“‘Is she always like this?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes—always—madam,’ said Mrs. Proudie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
returning; ‘always the same—always equally
adverse to impropriety of conduct of every description.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Proudie was an excellent woman according
to her light, yet Barchester would have been
a happier place to live in had her light been less
constant. A little flicker now and then, a momentary
relief from the glare, would have been
appreciated.</p>

<p>It is when the note of personal responsibility
has been forced beyond my ability that I feel beneath
my inherited Puritanism the stirring of a
vague Papistry. Instead of joining another protesting
society beginning with that feverish particle
“anti,” how delightful it would be to go out
and dicker with a well-conditioned pardoner</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Streight comen fro the Court of Rome!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Wearied with diatribes and resolutions, one falls
back upon the guileless bargainings of Simple
Simon.</p>

<p>“Let me taste your ware,” say I.</p>

<p>“Show me first your penny,” says the pardoner.</p>

<p>There is a renewal of one’s youth in this immortal
repartee.</p>

<p>There is no greater relief than to go out and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
buy something, especially if one can buy it cheap.
A great part of the attractiveness of the mediæval
indulgences lay in the fact that you could buy
them. They would not have seemed the same
if they had been given away, or if you had to work
them out like a road tax. To go out and buy a
little heart’s ease was an enticement.</p>

<p>Then again, the natural man, when he has to
do with an institution, is in a passive rather than
in an active mood. If it is instituted for his betterment,
he says, “Let it better me.” It seems
too bad that in the end it should throw all the
responsibility back upon himself.</p>

<p>A delightful old English traveler criticises the
methods of transportation he found in vogue in
parts of Germany. He says that on the Rhine
it was customary to make the passengers do the
rowing. “Their custome is that the passengers
must exercise themselves with oares and rowing,
<i>alternis vicibus</i>, a couple together. So that the
master of the boate (who methinks in honestie
ought either to do it himself or to procure some
others to do it for him) never roweth but when
his turne commeth. This exercise both for recreation
and health sake is I confesse very convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
for man. But to be tied unto it by way of strict
necessitie when one payeth well for his passage
was a thing that did not a little distaste my humour.”</p>

<p>This is the trouble which many of us find in
the modern methods of doing good. There
are all sorts of organizations which promise well.
But no sooner have we embarked on a worthy
undertaking than we find that we are expected
to work our passage. The officers of the boat
disclaim all further responsibility, leaving that to
private judgment. It is the true Protestant way
and it works excellently well, when it works at all.
It offers a fine challenge to disinterested virtue.
But there are occasions when the natural man
rebels. To have so much put upon him doth
“not a little distaste his humour.” He longs
for the good old times when there were thinkers
who were not above their business, and who when
he was at his wit’s end would do his thinking for
him. It’s the same way with being excused for
his shortcomings. Of course on a pinch he can
excuse himself, but he generally makes a pretty
poor job of it. It would be much more satisfactory
to have a duly authorized person who, for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
consideration, would assume the whole responsibility.
Of course if he had done something that
was really unpardonable, that would be another
matter. The law would have to take its course.
But there are a great many venial transgressions.
What he wants is some one who can assure him
that they are venial.</p>

<p>Let no good Protestant take offense at the finding
of a Pardoner’s Wallet in this twentieth century.
It is only a wallet containing tentative
suggestions concerning things pardonable. Nothing
is authoritatively signed and sealed.</p>

<p>Of one thing let the good Protestant take notice.
I would have my pardoner know his place.
He must not meddle with things too high for
him. He has no right to deal with the graver sins
or to speak for a higher power. He must not
speak even in the name of the Church, which has
worthier spokesmen than he. In a book on indulgences
the author says, “On the subject of
elongated, centenary, and millenary pardons, it
would take too much space to enlarge.” I should
rule out all such ambitious plans, not only from
lack of space but on conscientious grounds.</p>

<p>My pardoner should confine himself to a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
modest task. He should be the spokesman not
of any ecclesiastical power, but only of ordinary
and errant human nature. There are sins against
eternal law that must at all times be taken seriously.
The trouble with us poor mortals is that,
even in our remorse, we do not take very long
views. The judgment that seems most terrible to
us is that of the people who live next door. The
transgressions which loom largest are offenses
against social conventions and against our own
sensitive vanity. The pangs of remorse for an
act of remembered awkwardness are likely to be
more poignant than those which come as retribution
for an acknowledged crime.</p>

<p>Here is ample room for a present-day pardoner.
I should like to hear him make the cheery proclamation
of his trade.</p>

<p>“Good friends: You are not what you would
like to be. You are not what you think you are.
You are not what your neighbors think you are,—or
rather, you are not what you think your
neighbors think you are. Your foibles, your peccadillos,
your fallacies, and your prejudices are
more numerous than you imagine. But take heart
of grace, good people. These things are not unpardonable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
We indulgencers have learned to
make allowances for human nature. Let’s see
what’s in my wallet! No crowding! Each will
be served in his turn.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>If I were a duly licensed pardoner, I should
have a number of nicely engraved indulgences
for what are called sins of omission. Not that
I should attempt to extenuate the graver sort. I
should not hold out false hopes to thankless sons
or indifferent husbands. To be followed by such
riff-raff would spoil my trade with the better
classes. I should not have anything in my wallet
for the acrimonious critic, who brings a railing
accusation against his neighbor, and omits to sign
his name. Some omissions are unpardonable.</p>

<p>I should, at the beginning, confine my traffic
to those sins which easily beset conscientious persons
about half past two in the morning. We
have warrant for thinking that the sleep of the
just is refreshing. This is doubtless true of the
completely just; but with the just man in the
making it is frequently otherwise. There is a
stage in his strenuous moral career which is conducive
to insomnia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Having gone to sleep because he was tired, he
presently awakes for the same reason. He is,
however, only half awake. Those kindly comforters,
Common-sense, Humor, and Self-esteem,
whose function it is to keep him on reasonably
good terms with himself while he is doing his
necessary work, are still dozing.</p>

<p>Then Conscience appears,—a terrible apparition.
There is a vague menace in her glance.
The poor wretch cowers beneath it. Then is
unrolled the lengthening list of the things left
undone which ought to have been done. Every
unwritten letter and uncalled call and unattended
committee meeting and unread report emerges
from the vasty deep and adds its burden of unutterable
guilt. The Thing That Was Not Worth
Doing arises and demands with insatiate energy
that it be done at once. The Thing Half-done,
because there was no time to finish it, appears
with wan face accusing him of its untimely
taking off. The Stitch not Taken in Time
appears with its pitiful ninefold progeny all
doomed because of a moment’s inattention. It
seems that his moral raiment, instead of being
put together with an eye to permanency, has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
stitched on a single-thread machine and the end
of the seam never properly fastened. Now he is
pulling at the thread, and he sees the whole fabric
unraveling before his eyes.</p>

<p>His past existence looms before him as a battlefield
with a perpetual conflict of duties,—each
duty cruelly slain by its brother duty. While
the wailing of these poor ghosts is in his ears he
cannot rest. And yet he knows full well that at
half past two in the morning the one inexorable
duty is that he should go to sleep. Conscience
points to this as another duty left undone. Then
begins a new cycle of self-reproach.</p>

<p>At such times the sight of an indulgence neatly
framed hanging upon the bedroom wall would
be worth more than it would cost. It would save
doctor’s bills.</p>

<p>Even in our waking hours there is a tendency
for the sins of omission and the sorrows of omission
to pile up in monstrous fashion. There is a
curious ingenuity which some persons have in
loading themselves with burdens which do not
belong to them, and in extracting melancholy reflections
out of their good fortune. They will not
frankly accept a blessing in its own proper form,—it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>must come to them in a mournful disguise.
Poets seem particularly subject to these inversions
of feeling. Here are some lines entitled “Two
Sorrows:”—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Before Love came my eyes were dim with tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Because I had not known her gentle face.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Softly I said, “But when across the years</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Her smile illumes the darkness of my place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">All grief from my poor heart she will efface.”</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now Love is mine—she walks with me for aye</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Down paths of primrose and blue violet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But on my heart at every close of day</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A grief more keen than my old grief is set.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I weep for those who have not found Love yet.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a fine altruism about this sentiment
that one cannot but respect; yet I should hate to
live with a person who felt that way. One would
not venture on any little kindness for fear of opening
a new floodgate of tears.</p>

<p>I should feel like urging another point of view.
It is true that you are happy, happier than you
deserve. But don’t get morbid about it; take it
cheerfully. It’s not your fault. It seems selfish,
you say, to enjoy your blessings when there aren’t
enough to go round among all your fellow beings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Why, my dear fellow, that’s the only way to
make them go around. What if, theoretically, it
is a little selfish? We will readily pardon that for
the sake of the satisfaction we get out of seeing
you have a good time. We much prefer that you
should allow us to sympathize with you in your
happiness, rather than that you should inflict
upon us too much sympathy for our deprivations.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>There is opportunity for a thriving trade in
indulgences for necessarily slighted work. I emphasize
the idea of necessity, for I am aware of
the danger of gross abuse if poets and painters
should get the notion that they may find easy
absolution for the sin of offering to the public
something less than their best. Their best is none
too good. We must not, through misdirected
charity, lower the standards of self-respecting
artists.</p>

<p>But some of us are not artists. The ordinary
man is compelled to spend most of his time on
pot-boilers of one kind or another. When the pot
is merrily boiling, and all the odds and ends are
being mingled in a savory stew, I would allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the ordinary man some satisfaction. As fingers
were made before forks, so mediocrity was made
before genius. Has mediocrity no right to enjoy
its own work, just because it is not the very
best?</p>

<p>We of the commonalty who are fitted to live
happily in the comparative degree, allow ourselves
to be bullied by the superlative. There are uneasy
spirits who trouble Israel. They continually
quote the maxim that whatever is worth doing
is worth doing well. It is a good maxim in its
way, and causes no particular hardship until our
eyes are opened and we see what it means to do
anything superlatively well. When we are shown
by example the technical excellence which is
possible in the simplest forms of activity, and
the extent to which we fall short, we are appalled.
It is a wonder that we keep going at all when
we consider the slovenly way we breathe. And
yet breathing, though it well might engage all
our attention, is only one of the things we have
to do.</p>

<p>I attribute a good deal of the sense of stress in
modern life to the new standards of excellence
that are set in regard to the multifarious activities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
which make up our daily lives. We have to do
a hundred different things. This is not particularly
trying so long as it is merely touch and go.
In our amateurish way we rather enjoy the variety.
But when a hundred experts beset us, each
one of whom has made a life study of a particular
act, we are bowed in contrition. There is no
good in us but good intentions, and they cannot
save us. Our life story is summed up like that
of the unfortunate sparrow in the tragical history
of Cock Robin:</p>

</div>


<p>Our capacity for imperfectness seems absolutely
unlimited. The effort taken to achieve success in
one direction is from another point of view a dissipation
of energy. It is so much power withdrawn
from another possible achievement. The
most versatile men do not do all things equally
well, and while the world calls them successful
they are inwardly conscious of their manifold failures.
Mr. Balfour as Prime Minister of the British
Empire has had much to gratify his ambition,
but he takes the public into his confidence and
confesses that he is a bitterly disappointed man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
For, in addition to other accomplishments, he
plays golf, a game that develops a conscience of
its own. He plays well, but his conscience tells
him that he does not play as well as he might. “I
belong,” he says, “to that unhappy class of beings
forever pursued by remorse, who are conscious
that they threw away in youth opportunities that
were open to them of beginning golf at a time
of life when alone the muscles can be attuned to
the full perfection required by the most difficult
game that perhaps exists.”</p>

<p>Surely there must be a way by which such vain
regrets may be stilled. Life has its inevitable compromises.
We cannot always be at our best.
Take such a simple matter as that of masticating
our food. Before I had given much thought to
it, I should have said that it was something worth
doing and worth doing well. When I learned
that Mr. Gladstone was accustomed to chew each
morsel of food thirty-two times, I thought it
greatly to his credit. For a man who had so
many other things to do, that seemed enough.</p>

<p>But when I read a book of some three hundred
pages containing the whole duty of man in regard
to chewing, I was disheartened. Mr. Gladstone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
appeared to be a mere tyro guilty of bolting his
food. “The author has found that one fifth of
the midway section of the garden young onion,
sometimes called shallot, has required seven hundred
and twenty-two mastications before disappearing
through involuntary swallowing.”</p>

<p>The author evidently did his whole duty by
that young onion, and yet I should have pardoned
him if he had done something less. That doctrine
of his about involuntary swallowing being the
only kind that is morally justifiable, seems to me
to be too austere. If we have to swallow in the
end, why not show a cheerful willingness?</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Not only do those need comfort who do less
than is expected of them, those who do more are
often in an equally sorry plight. Their excellences
make them obnoxious to their neighbors,
and are treated as unpardonable offenses. I would
have a special line of indulgences for that class
of people known as the “unco guid.” I know no
persons more in need of charity, and who get so
little of it. Every man’s hand is against them,
especially every hand that wields the pen of a
ready writer. They seem predestinated to literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
reprobation, and that without regard to their
genuinely good works or to their continuance in
the same. And yet the whole extent of their crime
is that, being in some respects better than their
neighbors, they are painfully aware of the fact.
It is because they have tasted of the forbidden
knowledge of their own moral superiority that
their fall is deemed irremediable.</p>

<p>I confess that, in spite of all that has been said
against them, I have a tender feeling for them.
They are persecuted for self-righteousness without
the benefit of any beatitude. Why should we
consider it unpardonable to be fully cognizant of
one’s undoubted virtues? Of course unconscious
virtue is the more paradisiacal, while conscious
virtue often rubs one the wrong way. But while
there are so many worse things in the world, why
should we mind a little thing like that?</p>

<p>We listen to Dumas’ swashbuckling heroes
recounting their transgressions. We know that
they are not so bad as they would have us believe,
but we think no worse of them for that. But let
a thoroughly respectable man draw attention to his
own fine qualities, and we treat every deviation
from exact fact as a crime. When he indulges in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
some exaggeration and pictures himself as rather
better than he is, we cry, “Hypocrite!” If he
claims possession of some single virtue which
does not, in our judgment, harmonize with some
of his other characteristics, we treat him as if he
had stolen it. And yet, poor fellow! he may have
come honestly by this bit of finery, though he has
not been able to get other things to match it. All
this is unkind.</p>

<p>Whatever one may think of the “unco guid,”
every right-minded person must agree with me
that something ought to be done for the peace of
mind of the quiet, respectable, good people who
bear the heat and burden of the day. I have in
mind the people who pay taxes, and build homes,
and support churches and schools and hospitals,
and now and then go to the theatre. They are as
likely as not to be moderately well to do, and if
they are not, nobody knows it. When times are
hard with them, they keep their own counsels and
go about with head erect and the best foot forward.
You may see multitudes of these people
every day.</p>

<p>As a class, these people are sadly put upon.
They are criticised not only for their own shortcomings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
but for those of all their irresponsible
fellow citizens. If anything goes wrong they are
sure to hear about it, for they listen to sermons,
and read the newspapers, and attend meetings.
No reformer can be truly eloquent who does not
point his finger at his hearer, and say, “Thou art
the man!” Now, unfortunately, the real delinquents
are usually absent, and the right-minded,
conscientious hearer of the word, who is doing
all he can for social regeneration, even to the verge
of nervous prostration, has to act as substitute.
He has been so often assured that he is the guilty
man that, by and by, he comes to believe it.</p>

<p>He walks to church with his family only to be
told that it is his fault, and the fault of those like
him, that other people have gone off in their
automobiles. Perhaps, if he had walked differently,
he might have made church-going more
attractive to them. The evils of intemperance
are laid at his door. It is not worth while to blame
the drunkard or the saloon-keeper; they are not
within ear-shot. As to pauperism and vice, every
one knows that they arise from social conditions;
and pray who is responsible for these conditions
unless it be the meek man who sits in the pew,—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
least, he is the only one who can readily be
made to assume the responsibility.</p>

<p>There is something wholesome in all this if it
be not overdone. I, myself, like to have my fling
at the man who is trying to do his duty, and to
twit him occasionally for not doing more. It
keeps him from self-righteousness. But sometimes
it is carried too far, and the poor man staggers
under a load of vicarious guilt.</p>

<p>I especially hate to see the man who is trying
to do his duty given over to the censures of those
who do not try. There is something very harsh
in the judgment of the ne’er-do-well upon his
well-to-do brother. His attitude is the extreme
of phariseeism, as he contrasts his own generous
and care-free nature with the pickayunish prudence
which he scorns. To be sure, his brother
in the end pays his debts for him, but he does it
with a narrow scrutiny which robs the act of its
natural charm. His acts of helpfulness are marred
by a tendency to didacticism. All these things
are laid up against him.</p>

<p>But allowance should be made for the difference
in condition. Ne’er-do-wellness is an expansive
state. There are no natural limits to it. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
develops broad views, and its peculiar virtues have
a free field. It is different with well-to-doness,
which is a precarious condition with a very narrow
margin of safety. The ne’er-do-well can afford to
be generous, seeing that his generosity costs him
nothing. He is free from all belittling calculations
necessary to those who are compelled to
adjust means to ends,—he is indifferent to ends
and he has no means.</p>

<p>When the morally responsible person finds
himself too much put upon, I would grant him
a generous indulgence. After all, I would tell
him, the prudential virtues are not so bad. It is a
good deal of an achievement to make both ends
meet. I am not disposed to be too hard on those
who accomplish this, even though I may think a
little fullness in their moral garments might be
more becoming.</p>

<p>I should also make provision for the pardon
of those good people who are harshly judged because
their virtues are unseasonable. But their
case involves delicate considerations that can best
be treated in another chapter.</p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE are certain philosophers who have
fallen into the habit of speaking slightingly
of Time and Space. Time, they say, is only a
poor concept of ours corresponding to no ultimate
reality, and Space is little better. They are
merely mental receptacles into which we put our
sensations. We are assured that could we get at
the right point of view we should see that real
existence is timeless. Of course we cannot get
at the right point of view, but that does not
matter.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand how philosophers can
talk in that way, for familiarity with great subjects
breeds contempt; but we of the laity cannot
dismiss either Time or Space so cavalierly. Having
once acquired the time-habit, it is difficult
to see how we could live without it. We are
accustomed to use the minutes and hours as stepping-stones,
and we pick our way from one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
another. If it were not for them, we should find
ourselves at once beyond our depth. It is the
succession of events which makes them interesting.
There is a delightful transitoriness about
everything, and yet the sense that there is more
where it all comes from. To the unsophisticated
mind Eternity is not the negation of Time; it is
having all the time one wants. And why may
not the unsophisticated mind be as nearly right in
such matters as any other?</p>

<p>In a timeless existence there would be no distinction
between now and then, before and after.
Yesterdays and to-days would be merged in one
featureless Forever. When we met one another it
would be impertinent to ask, “How do you do?”
The chilling answer would be: “I do not do; I
am.” There would be nothing more to say to one
who had reduced his being to such bare metaphysical
first principles.</p>

<p>I much prefer living in Time, where there are
circumstances and incidents to give variety to
existence. There is a dramatic instinct in all of
us that must be satisfied. We watch with keen
interest for what is coming next. We would
rather have long waits than to have no shifting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
of the scenes, and all the actors on the stage at
once, doing nothing.</p>

<p>An open-minded editor prints the following
question from an anxious reader in regard to a
serial story appearing in his paper: “Does it
make any difference in reading the serial whether
I begin with Saturday’s chapter and read backward
toward Monday, or should the tale be read
as the chapters appear?”</p>

<p>The editor assures his subscriber that the story
is of such uniform excellence that it would read
well in either direction. In practical affairs our
dramatic instinct will not allow us this latitude.
We insist upon certain sequences. There is an
expectancy that one thing will lead up to another.
We do not take kindly to an anti-climax or to
an anachronism. The Hebrew sage declares, “He
hath made everything beautiful in his time.” That
is in the right time, but alas for the beautiful
thing that falls upon the wrong time! It is bewitched
beyond all recognition by the old necromancer
who has power to make “ancient good
uncouth.”</p>

<p>It is just here that charity requires that we
should discriminate. There is a situation that demands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the services of a kind-hearted indulgencer.
Ethics has to do with two kinds of offenses: one
is against the eternal and unchanging standards
of right and wrong, and the other against the
perpetually varying conditions of the passing day.
We are continually confusing the two. We visit
upon the ancient uncouth good which comes
honestly stumbling on its belated journey toward
the perfect, all the condemnation that properly
belongs to willful evil. It is lucky if it gets off so
easily as that, for we are likely to add the pains
and penalties which belong to hypocritical pretense.
As for a premature kind of goodness coming
before there is time properly to classify it, that
must expect martyrdom. Something of the old
feeling about strangers still survives in us. We
think it safer to treat the stranger as an enemy.
If he survives our attacks we may make friends
with him.</p>

<p>Those good people who, in their devotion to
their own ideals, have ignored all considerations
of timeliness, have usually passed through sore
tribulations. They have been the victims of cruel
misunderstandings. Such, for example, was Saint
Cerbonius. Cerbonius is one of the October saints.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
October is a good month for saints. The ecclesiastical
calendar gives us a sense of spiritual mellowness
and fruitfulness. The virtues celebrated
are without the acidity which belongs to some
other seasons: witness Saint Francis of Assisi,
Saint Teresa, Saint Luke, the beloved physician,
Saint John Capistran, of whom it is written, “he
had a singular talent for reconciling inveterate
enemies and inducing them to love one another.”
Cerbonius has a modest place in this autumnal
brotherhood; indeed, in some Lives of the Saints,
he is not even mentioned, and yet he had the
true October spirit. Nevertheless, his good was
evil spoken of, and he came near to excommunication,
and all because of his divergence from
popular custom in the matter of time.</p>

<p>It seems that he lived towards the end of the
sixth century, and that he was bishop of Piombino.
Very soon a great scandal arose, for it was
declared that the bishop was neglecting his duties.
At the accustomed hour the citizens came to the
cathedral for their devotions, only to find the chancel
devoid of clergy. Cerbonius and his priests
were at that moment comfortably seated at breakfast.
Each succeeding morning witnessed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
same scene. The bishop was evidently an infidel
scoffing at the rites of religion. Appeal was made
to Rome, and legates were appointed who confirmed
the astounding rumors. At last Cerbonius
went to Rome to plead his cause; but only by a
special miracle was his character cleared. The
miracle induced the authorities to look into the
matter more carefully, and it was found that Cerbonius,
instead of neglecting his duties, had been
carried away by holy zeal. While the people of
Piombino were still in their beds, Cerbonius and
his clergy would be celebrating mass. As for
breakfast, that was quite late in the day.</p>

<p>It is easy to be wise after the event, and now
that the matter has been cleared up it is evident
that all the religion was not on one side. Taking
a large view of the subject, we see that in the
course of the twenty-four hours the bishop spent
as much time in the church as the most scrupulous
parishioner could ask. But it was just this
large view that they were unwilling to take. With
them it was now or never. They judged his character
by the cross-section which they took at one
particular hour.</p>

<p>I suppose that, had I lived in Piombino, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
should have been a moderate anti-Cerbonian.
Cerbonius was in error, but not in mortal sin. He
was guilty of a heresy that disturbed the peace
of the church,—that of early rising. So long as
early rising is held only as a creed for substance
of doctrine and set forth as a counsel of perfection,
it may be tolerated, but when the creed becomes
a deed it awakens fanatical opposition. This
breeds schism. A person cannot be popular who
gets the reputation of being a human alarm clock.
The primitive instinct in regard to an alarm clock
is to stop it. If Cerbonius had possessed the tact
necessary to a man in his position, he would not
only have done his duty, but he would have done
it at the time most convenient to the greatest
number. His virtue was unseasonable; but between
a man of unseasonable virtue and an abandoned
character who has no virtue at all, there is
a great difference. It is just this difference which
the majority of people will not see. They make
no distinction between one who deliberately offends
against the eternal verities and one who
accidentally tramples upon a temporary verity
that he didn’t know was there.</p>

<p>Most of our quarrels do not concern absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
right and wrong; they arise from disputes about
the time of day. Two persons may have the
same qualities and convictions and yet never
agree. An ironical fate sets them at cross purposes
and they never meet without irritating contradictions.
It is all because their moods do not
synchronize. One is always a little too slow, the
other a little too fast. When one is in fine fettle
the other is just beginning to get tired. They
are equally serious, but never on the same occasion,
and so each accuses the other of heartless
frivolity. They have an equal appreciation of a
pleasantry, but they never see it at the same instant.
One gives it an uproarious welcome when
the other is speeding the parting guest.</p>

<p>Two quick-tempered people may live together
very comfortably so long as they lose their tempers
simultaneously; they are then ready to make
up at the same time. They get on like an automobile,
by a series of small explosions accurately
timed. But when a quick-tempered person is unequally
yoked with one who is slow to wrath, the
case is difficult. The slowness causes continual
apprehension. The fuse burns so deliberately that
it seems to have gone out and then the explosion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
comes. In such cases there can be no adequate
explanation. The offender would apologize
if he could remember what the offense was, and
he doesn’t dare to ask.</p>

<p>Said one theologian to another: “The difference
between us is that your God is my Devil.”
This involved more than the mere matter of nomenclature.
It upset the spiritual time-table and
caused disastrous collisions. When one good man
set forth valiantly to fight the Devil, the other
would charge him with disturbing his worship.</p>

<p>The fact that one man’s work is another man’s
play is equally fruitful in misunderstandings. The
proverbial irritability of the literary and artistic
tribes arises in part from this cause. They feel that
they are never taken seriously. When we go to
a good play we find it so easy to be amused that
we do not realize what hard work it is for those
whose business it is to be amusing. The better
the work, the more effortless it seems to us. On
a summer afternoon we take up a novel in a mood
which to the conscientious novelist seems sacrilege.
He has thrown all the earnestness of his
nature into it, and he wants his message to be
received in the same spirit. We have earnestness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of nature too, but we have expended it in other
directions. Having finished our work, we take
our rest by reading his. It is a pleasant way to
pass the time. This enrages the novelist, and he
writes essays to rebuke us. He calls us Philistines
and other hard names, and says that we are incapable
of appreciating literary art.</p>

<p>But what is our offense? We have used his
work for our own purpose, which was to rest our
minds. We got out of it what at the time we
needed. Does he not act in very much the same
way? Did we not see him at the town-meeting
when a very serious question concerning the management
of the town poor-house was to be settled?
It was a time when every good citizen
should have shown his interest by speaking an
earnest word. Unmindful of all this, he sat
through the meeting with the air of an amused
outsider. He paid little attention to the weighty
arguments of the selectmen, but noted down all
their slips in grammar. He confessed unblushingly
that he attended the meeting simply to get
a little local color. What is to become of the
country when a tax-payer will take the duties of
citizenship so lightly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>These recriminations go on endlessly. Because
we do not see certain qualities in action, we deny
their existence. The owl has a reputation for
sedentary habits and unpractical wisdom, simply
because he keeps different business hours from
those to which we are accustomed. Could we
look in on him during the rush time, we would
find him a hustling fellow. He has no time to
waste on unremunerative meditation. This is his
busy night. How ridiculous is the sleepiness of
the greater part of the animal world! There is
the lark nodding for hours on his perch. They
say he never really wakes up—at least, nobody
has seen him awake.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>There is a pedagogical theory according to
which each individual in his early life repeats
quite accurately the history of mankind up to
date. He passes through all the successive stages
in the history of the race, with a few extra flourishes
now and then to indicate the surprises which
the future may have in store for us. The history
of civilization becomes, for the initiated, the rehearsal
of the intensely interesting drama of the
nursery and the schoolroom. It lacks the delicacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
of the finished performance, but it presents the argument
clearly enough and suggests the necessary
stage business. The young lady who attempts to
guide a group of reluctant young cave-dwellers
from one period in human culture to another is not
surprised at any of their tantrums. Her only anxiety
is lest some form of barbarism appropriate
to their condition may have been skipped. Her
chief function is like that of the chorus in the
Greek tragedy, to explain to the audience each
dramatic situation as it unfolds.</p>

<p>I should not like to take the responsibility of
running such an excellent theory into the ground,
yet it does seem to me that it might be carried
further. Granted that childhood is innocent savagery
and that adolescence is gloriously barbaric,
what is the matter with mature life? Does it not
have any remnants of primitiveness? Does not
Tennyson write of “the gray barbarian”?</p>

<p>The transitions from primitive savagery to civilization
which took the race centuries to accomplish
are repeated by the individual, not once but
many times. After we get the knack of it, we can
run over the alphabet of human progress backwards
as well as forwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Exit Troglodyte. Enter Philosopher discoursing
on disinterested virtue. Reënter Troglodyte.
Such dramatic transformations may be expected
by merely changing the subject of the conversation.</p>

<p>I remember sitting, one Sunday afternoon, on
a vine-covered piazza reading to a thoughtful
and irascible friend. The book was Martineau’s
“Endeavors after the Christian Life.” In the
middle of the second discourse my friend’s dog
rushed into the street to attack the dog of a
passer-by. It was one of those sudden and
unpredictable antipathies to which the members
of the canine race are subject. My friend, instead
of preserving a dignified neutrality, rushed
into the fray in the spirit of offensive partisanship,
and instantly became involved in an altercation
with the gentleman on the sidewalk. Canes were
brandished, fierce threats were exchanged, and
only by the greatest efforts were the Homeric heroes
separated. Returning to his chair, my friend
handed me the book, saying, “Now let us go
on with our religion.” The religion went on as
placidly as aforetime. There was no sense of
confusion. The wrath of Achilles did not disturb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the calm spirituality of Martineau. Each
held the centre of the stage for his own moment,
and there was no troublesome attempt to harmonize
them. Why should there be? Martineau
was not talking about dogs.</p>

<p>I know no greater luxury than that of thinking
well of my fellow-men. It is a luxury which
a person in narrow circumstances, who is compelled
to live within the limits of strict veracity,
sometimes feels to be beyond his means. Yet I
think it no harm to indulge in a little extravagance
in this direction. The best device for seeing
all sorts and conditions of men to advantage
is to arrange them in their proper chronological
order.</p>

<p>For years it was the custom to speak disparagingly
of the “poor whites” of our Southern
mountains. Shut off from the main currents of
modern life, they seemed unpardonably unprogressive.
They were treated as mere degenerates.
At last, however, a keener and kindlier observer
hit upon a happy phrase. These isolated mountaineers,
he said, have retained the characteristic
habits of a former generation. They are our “contemporary
ancestors.” Instantly everything was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
put in a more favorable light; for we all are disposed
to see the good points in our ancestors.
After all, the whole offense with which these
mountain people are charged is that they are behind
the times. In our bona-fide contemporaries
this is a grave fault, but in our ancestors it is pardonable.
We do not expect them to live up to
our standards, and so we give them credit for living
up to their own.</p>

<p>In this case we agree to consider fifty miles of
mountain roads, if they be sufficiently bad, as the
equivalent of rather more than a hundred years
of time. Behind the barrier the twentieth century
does not yet exist. Many things may still be
winked at for which the later generation may be
sternly called to repentance. Then, too, the end
of the eighteenth century has some good points
of its own. These contemporary ancestors of ours
are of good old English stock, and we begin to
look upon them with a good deal of family
pride.</p>

<p>But when we once accept poor roads as the
equivalent of the passage of time, putting people
at the other end into another generation, there is
no knowing what we may come to in our charitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
interpretations. For there are other equally
effective non-conductors of thought. By the simple
device of not knowing how to read, a man
cuts off some thousands of culture years and saves
himself from no end of intellectual distractions.
He becomes the contemporary of “earth’s vigorous,
primitive sons.” If to his illiteracy he adds
native talent and imagination, there is a chance
for him to make for himself some of those fine
old discoveries which we lose because we got the
answer from some blabbing book before we had
come to the point of asking the question. Of
course the danger is that if he has native talent
and imagination he will learn to read, and it must
be confessed that for this reason we do not get
such a high order of illiterates as formerly.</p>

<p>I once made the acquaintance of an ancient
Philosopher. His talents were for cosmogony, and
his equipment would have been deemed ample
in the days when cosmogony was the fashion. He
had meditated much on the genesis of things and
had read nothing, so that his speculations were
uncontaminated by the investigations of others.
He was just the man to construct a perfectly simple
and logical theory of the universe, and he did it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
His universe was not like that of which our sciences
give us imperfect glimpses, but it was very satisfactory
to him. He was very fair in dealing with
facts; he explained all that could be explained
by his system. As the only criterion of a fact
which he recognized was that it agreed with his
system, there was none left over to trouble him.
His manner of thought was so foreign to that of
our time that his intellectual ability was not widely
appreciated; yet had his birth not been so long
delayed, he might have been the founder of a
school and have had books written about him.
For so far as I could learn, his views of the four
elements of earth, air, fire, and water, were very
much like those of the early Greek physicists.
Had I taken him as a fellow American, I should
have dismissed him as not up to date; but considering
him in the light of an ancient sage, I found
much in him to admire.</p>

<p>Once upon the coast of Maine I came upon
a huge wooden cylinder. Within it was a smaller
one, and in the centre, seated upon a swinging
platform, was the owner of the curious contrivance.
He was a mild-eyed, pleasant-spoken man, whom
it was a pleasure to meet. He explained that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
was “The Amphibious Vehicle,” and that it
would move equally well on land or sea.</p>

<p>“You know,” said he, “what the prophet Ezekiel
said about the ‘wheel in the middle of a
wheel’?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Well, this is it.”</p>

<p>There was something convincing in this matter-of-fact
statement. The “wheel within a wheel”
had been to me little more than a figure of speech,
but here it was made out of good pine lumber,
with a plank in the middle for the living creature
to sit on. It was as if I had fallen through
a trap door into another age. Here was a literal-minded
contemporary of Ezekiel, who, having
heard of the wheel within a wheel, had proceeded
at once to make one. I ascended into the precarious
seat, and we conversed upon the spiritual
and temporal possibilities of the vehicle. I found
that on the scriptural argument he was clearly
ahead of me, being able to quote chapter and
verse with precision, while my references were
rather vague. In the field of mechanics he was
also my superior. I could not have made the
vehicle, having not yet emerged beyond the stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
age. As we talked I forgot that we were at the
mouth of the Penobscot. We were on the “river
of Chebar,” and there was no knowing what might
happen.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The belated philosophers and inventors, who
think the thoughts of the ancient worthies after
them, live peaceful lives. What matters it that
they are separated by a millennium or two from
the society in which they were fitted to shine?
They are self-sufficing, and there are few who
care to contradict them. It is not so with one
who is morally belated. There is something pathetic
in the condition of one who cherishes the
ambition of being a good man, but who has not
informed himself of the present “state of the art.”</p>

<p>Now and then an ethical revolution takes place.
New ideals are proclaimed, and in their light all
things are judged. The public conscience becomes
sensitive in regard to courses of conduct
which heretofore had been unchallenged. Every
such advance involves a waste in established
reputations. There are always excellent men who
are not aware of what has been going on. They
keep on conforming scrupulously to the old standards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
being good in the familiar ways that were
commended in their youth. After a time they
find themselves in an alien world, and in that
world they are no longer counted among the best
people. The tides of moral enthusiasm are all
against them. The good man feels his solid
ground of goodness slipping away from under
him. Time has played false with his moral conventionalities.
He is like a polar bear on a fast-diminishing
iceberg, growling at the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>When a great evil has been recognized by the
world, there is a revision of all our judgments. A
new principle of classification is introduced, by
which we differentiate the goats from the sheep.
It is hard after that to revive the old admirations.
The temperance agitation of the last century has
not abolished drunkenness, but it has made the
conception of a pious, respectable drunkard seem
grotesque. It has also reduced the business of
liquor-selling to a decidedly lower place in the
esteem of the community. When we read to-day
of the horrors of the slave trade, we reconstruct in
our imagination the character of the slave trader,—and
a brutal wretch he is. But in his day the
Guinea captain held his own with the best. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
was a good husband and father, a kind neighbor,
a generous benefactor. President Ezra Stiles of
Yale College, in his “Literary Diary,” describes
such a beautiful character. It was when Dr. Stiles
was yet a parish minister in Newport that one
of his parishioners died, of whom he wrote:
“God had blessed him with a good Estate and
he and his Family have been eminent for Hospitality
to all and Charity to the poor and afflicted.
At his death he recommended Religion to his
Children and told them that the world was nothing.
The only external blemish on his Character was
that he was a little addicted to the marvelous in
stories of what he had seen in his Voyages and
Travels. But in his Dealings he was punctual,
upright, and honest, and (except as to the Flie in
the Oynment, the disposition to tell marvelous
Stories of Dangers, Travels, &amp;c.), in all other
Things he was of a sober and good moral character,
respected and beloved of all, so as to be almost
without enemies. He was forward in all the concerns
of the Church and Congregation, consulting
its Benefit and peaceably falling in with the general
sense without exciting quarrels, parties, &amp;c.,
and even when he differed from his Brethren he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
so differed from them that they loved him amidst
the differences. He was a peaceable man and
promoted Peace.”</p>

<p>It was in 1773 that this good man died in the
odor of sanctity. It is quite incidentally that we
learn that “he was for many years a Guinea captain,
and had no doubt of the slave trade.” His
pastor suggests that he might have chosen another
business than that of “buying and selling
the human species.” Still, in 1773, this did not
constitute an offense serious enough to be termed
a fly in the ointment. In 1785, Dr. Stiles speaks
of the slave trade as “a most iniquitous trade in
the souls of men.” Much may happen in a dozen
years in changing one’s ideas of moral values. In
another generation the civilized world was agreed
that the slave trade was piracy. After that there
were no fine Christian characters among the slave
traders.</p>

<p>There is evidence that at the present time
there is an awakening of the social conscience
that threatens as great a revolution as that which
came with the abolition of the slave trade. Business
methods which have been looked upon as
consistent with high moral character are being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
condemned as “the sum of all villainies.” The
condemnation is not yet universal, and there are
still those who are not conscious that anything has
happened. The Christian monopolist, ruthlessly
crushing out his competitors and using every trick
known to the trade, has no more doubts as to the
rightfulness of his proceedings than had the good
Newport captain in regard to the slave trade.</p>

<p>It is a good time to have his obituary written.
His contemporaries appreciate his excellent private
virtues, and have been long accustomed to
look leniently on his public wrong-doing. The
new generation, having agreed to call his methods
robbery, may find the obituary eulogies amusing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c3">AN HOUR WITH OUR PREJUDICES</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E may compare the human mind to a
city. It has its streets, its places of business
and amusement, its citizens of every degree.
When one person is introduced to another it is
as if the warder drew back the bolts, and the
gates were thrown open. If he comes well recommended
he is given the freedom of the city.
In the exercise of this freedom, however, the
stranger should show due caution.</p>

<p>There is usually a new quarter. Here the streets
are well lighted and policed, the crowds are cosmopolitan,
and the tourist who wanders about
looking at the shop windows is sure of a civil
reply to his questions. There is no danger of
highway robbers, though of course one may be
taken in by confidence men. But if he be of an
inquiring mind and a lover of the picturesque, he
is not satisfied with this. After all, the new quarters
are very much alike, and one tires after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
while of shop windows. The visitor longs to explore
the old town, with its winding ways, with
its overhanging houses, and its mild suggestions
of decay.</p>

<p>But in the mental city the lover of the picturesque
must remember that he carries his life in
his hands. It is not safe to say to a casual acquaintance,
“Now I have a fair idea of that part
of your mind which is like that of any other decently
educated person. I have seen all the spick
and span show places, and admired all the modern
improvements. Where are your ruins? I should
like to poke around a while in the more dilapidated
section of your intellect.”</p>

<p>Ah, but that is the Forbidden City. It is inhabited,
not by orderly citizens, under the rule of
Right Reason, but by a lawless crowd known as
the Prejudices. They are of all sorts and conditions.
Some are of aristocratic lineage. They
come from a long line of hereditary chiefs, who,
as their henchmen have deserted them, have recreated
into their crumbling strongholds. Some
are bold, roistering blades who will not stand a
question; dangerous fellows, these, to meet in the
dark! The majority, perhaps, are harmless folk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
against whom the worst that can be said is that
they have a knack of living without visible means
of support.</p>

<p>A knowledge of human nature, as distinguished
from a knowledge of moral philosophy, is a perception
of the important part played by instinctive
likes and dislikes, by perverse antipathies, by
odd ends of thought, by conclusions which have
got hopelessly detached from their premises—if
they ever had any. The formal philosopher,
judging others by himself, works on the assumption
that man is naturally a reasoning animal,
whereas experience teaches that the craving for
the reasonable is an acquired taste.</p>

<p>Of course we all have reasons for our opinions,—plenty
of them! But in the majority of cases
they stand not as antecedents, but as consequents.
There is a reversal of the rational order like that
involved in Dr. Hale’s pleasant conceit of the
young people who adopted a grandmother. In
spite of what intellectual persons say, I do not
see how we can get along without prejudices. A
prejudice is defined as “an opinion or decision
formed without due examination of the facts or
arguments which are necessary to a just and impartial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
determination.” Now, it takes a good deal
of time to make a due examination of facts and
arguments, even in regard to a small matter. In
the meantime our minds would be sadly unfurnished.
If we are to make a fair show in the
world, we must get our mental furniture when
we set up housekeeping, and pay for it on the
installment plan.</p>

<p>Instead of taking a pharisaic attitude toward
our neighbor’s prejudices, it is better to cultivate
a wise tolerance, knowing that human intercourse
is dependent on the art of making allowances.
This is consistent with perfect honesty. There is
always something to admire if the critic is sufficiently
discriminating. When you are shown a
bit of picturesque dilapidation, it is quite possible
to enjoy it. Said the Hebrew sage, “I went by
the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
the man void of understanding; and, lo, it was all
grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered
the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
broken down. Then I saw, and considered it well:
I looked upon it, and received instruction.”</p>

<p>His point of view was that of a moralist. Had
he also been a bit of an artist, the sight of the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
wall with its tangle of flowering briers would have
had still further interest.</p>

<p>When one’s intellectually slothful neighbor
points with pride to portions of his untilled fields,
we must not be too hard upon him. We also
have patches of our own that are more picturesque
than useful. Even if we ourselves are
diligent husbandmen, making ceaseless war on
weeds and vermin, there are times of relenting.
Have you never felt a tenderness when the
ploughshare of criticism turned up a prejudice
of your own? You had no heart to harm the</p>

<p>It could not give a good account of itself. It had
been so long snugly ensconced that it blinked
helplessly in the garish light. Its</p>

</div>


<p>You would have been very angry if any one had
trampled upon it.</p>

<p>This is the peculiarity about a prejudice. It is
very appealing to the person who holds it. A man
is seldom offended by an attack on his reasoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
judgments. They are supported by evidence and
can shift for themselves. Not so with a prejudice.
It belongs not to the universal order; it
is his very own. All the chivalry of his nature is
enlisted in its behalf. He is, perhaps, its only
defense against the facts of an unfriendly world.</p>

<p>We cannot get along without making allowances
for these idiosyncrasies of judgment. Conversation
is impossible where each person insists
on going back, all the time, to first principles,
and testing everything by an absolute standard.
With a person who is incapable of changing his
point of view we cannot converse; we can only
listen and protest. We are in the position of one
who, conscious of the justice of his cause, attempts
to carry on a discussion over the telephone with
“Central.” He only hears an inhuman buzzing
sound indicating that the line is busy. There is
nothing to do but to “hang up the ’phone.”</p>

<p>When a disputed question is introduced, one
may determine the true conversationalist by applying
the method of Solomon. Let it be proposed
to divide the subject so that each may have
his own. Your eager disputant will be satisfied,
your genial talker is aghast at the proposition, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
he realizes that it would kill the conversation.
Instead of holding his own, he awaits developments.
He is in a mood which can be satisfied
with something less than a final judgment. It is
not necessary that his friend’s opinions should
be just; it is sufficient that they are characteristic.
Whatever turn the talk may take, he preserves
an easy temper. He is a heresy-hunter,—not of
the grim kind that goes hunting with a gun; he
carries only a camera. If he stirs up a strange
doctrine he does not care to destroy it. When he
gets a snap-shot at human nature he says,—</p>

<p>An English gentleman relates a conversation
he had with Prince Bismarck. The prince was
inclined to take a pessimistic view of the English
people. He thought that there was a degeneration
in the race, which he attributed to the growing
habit of drinking water. “Not that he believed
that there was any particular virtue <i>per se</i> inherent
in alcoholic drink; but he was sorry to hear that
the old ‘three bottle men’ were dying out and
leaving no successors. He had a suspicion that it
meant shrinkage in those qualities of the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
which had made them what they were in the past,
and for which he had always felt a sincere admiration.”</p>

<p>It would have been very easy to drift into
debate over this proposition. The English gentleman,
however, defended his countrymen more
diplomatically. “I replied that with regard to
the water-drinking proclivities of my countrymen
there was a good deal of calumny connected with
the story. It is true that a certain section of English
society has indeed taken to water as a beverage.
But to argue therefrom that the English
people have become addicted to water would be
to draw premature conclusions from insufficient
data. In this way I was able to calm Prince Bismarck’s
fears in regard to what the future might
bring forth, and our conversation reverted to
Royalty.”</p>

<p>Each nation has its own set of preconceptions.
We must take them altogether, or not at all.
They are as compact and as natural a growth
as the concentric layers of an onion. Here is a
sentence from Max Müller’s “Autobiography,”
thrown out quite incidentally. He has been telling
how strange it seemed, when first coming to Oxford,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
to find that the students got along without
dueling. Fighting with swords seemed to him the
normal method of developing manliness, though
he adds that in the German universities “pistol
duels are generally preferred by theological students,
because they cannot easily get a living if
the face is scarred all over.”</p>

<p>This remark must be taken as one would take
a slice of the national onion. One assumption fits
into another. To an Englishman or an American
there is an incongruity that approaches the grotesque,—because
our prejudices are different.
It all becomes a matter-of-fact statement when we
make the proper assumptions in regard to dueling
in general and theological duels in particular.
Assuming that it is necessary for theological students
to fight duels, and that the congregations
are prejudiced against ministers whose faces have
been slashed by swords, what is left for the poor
theologues but pistols? Their method may seem
more dangerous than that adopted by laymen, but
Max Müller explains that the danger is chiefly to
the seconds.</p>

<p>Individual peculiarities must be taken into
account in the same way. Prince Bismarck, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
dining with the Emperor, inquired the name of
the brand of champagne, which proved to be a
cheap German article. “The Emperor explained,
‘I drink it from motives of economy, as I have a
large family; then again I drink it from patriotic
motives.’ Thereupon I said to the Emperor,
‘With me, your Majesty, patriotism stops short
in the region of my stomach.’”</p>

<p>It is evident that here was a difference not to
be arbitrated by reason. If the Emperor could
not understand the gastronomic limitations to the
Chancellor’s patriotism, neither could the Chancellor
enter into the Emperor’s anxieties, as he
economized for the sake of his large family.</p>

<p>One cannot but wonder at the temerity of a
person who plunges into conversation with a
stranger without any preliminary scouting or
making sure of a line of retreat. Ordinary prudence
would suggest that the first advances should
be only in the nature of a reconnoissance in force.
You may have very decided prejudices of your
own, but it is not certain that they will fraternize
with those of your new acquaintance. There is
danger of falling into an ambush. There are painful
occasions when we remember the wisdom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the Son of Sirach: “Many have fallen by the
edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen
by the tongue.” The mischief of it is that the
most kindly intent will not save us. The path of
the lover of mankind is beset by difficulties for
which he is not prepared. There are so many antagonisms
that are unpredictable.</p>

<p>When Nehemiah came to rebuild the walls of
Jerusalem he remarked grimly, “When Sanballat
the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly
that there was come a man to seek the welfare of
the children of Israel;” and the trouble was that
a large number of the children of Israel themselves
seem to have resented the interference with their
habitual misfortunes. The experience of Nehemiah
is that of most reformers. One would suppose
that the person who aims at the greatest
good for the greatest number would be greeted
with instant applause. The difficulty is that the
greatest good is just what the greatest number
will not tolerate. One does not need to believe
in human depravity to recognize the prejudice
which most persons have against anything which
is proposed as good for them. The most successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
philanthropists are those who most skillfully
conceal their benevolent intent.</p>

<p>In Coleman’s “Life of Charles Reade” there is
a paragraph which gives us a glimpse of a prejudice
that has resisted the efforts of the most
learned men to eradicate it. An incident is there
recorded that took place when Reade was a fellow
in Magdalen College. “Just as I was about to
terminate my term of office (I hope with credit
to myself and the ’Varsity), an untoward incident
occurred which embittered my relations for life
with two very distinguished men. Professor Goldwin
Smith and his friend John Conington, who
belonged to us, had attempted to inaugurate a
debating society. A handful of unmannerly young
cubs, resenting the attempt to teach them political
economy, ducked poor Conington under the
college pump.”</p>

<p>“Resenting the attempt to teach them political
economy!”—What is the source of that resentment?
What psychologist has fathomed the abyss
of the dark prejudice which the natural man has
against those who would improve his mind? It
is a feud which reaches back into hoar antiquity.
Doubtless the accumulated grievances of generations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
of schoolboys have intensified the feud, but
no amelioration of educational methods has put
an end to it. In the most successful teacher you
may detect a nervous strain like that which the
trainer of wild beasts in the arena undergoes. His
is a perilous position, and every faculty must be
on the alert to hold the momentary ascendency.
A single false motion, and the unmannerly young
cubs would be upon their victim.</p>

<p>Must we not confess that this irrational resentment
against our intellectual benefactors survives,
in spite of all discipline, into mature life? We
may enlarge the area of our teachableness, but there
are certain subjects in regard to which we do not
care to be set right. The polite conventionality
according to which a person is supposed to know
his own business is an evidence of this sensitiveness.
Of course the assumption is not justified by
facts. A man’s own business is just the thing he
is conscious of not knowing, and he would give
anything in a quiet way to find out. Yet when
a candid friend ventures to instruct him, the old
irrational resentment flashes out. What we call
tact is the ability to find before it is too late what
it is that our friends do not desire to learn from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
us. It is the art of withholding, on proper occasions,
information which we are quite sure would
be good for them.</p>

<p>The prejudice against our intellectual superiors,
which leads us to take their well-meant endeavors
in our behalf as of the nature of personal insults,
is matched by the equally irrational repulsion
which many superior people have for their inferiors.
Nothing can be more illogical than the
attitude of these gifted ones who use their gifts
as bludgeons with which to belabor the rest of us.
When we read the writings of men who have
a stimulating sense of their own genius, we are
struck by their nervous irritability whenever they
mention “mediocrity.” The greater number of the
quarrels of the authors, which the elder Disraeli
chronicled, arose from the fact that the authors
had the habit of accusing one another of this vice.
One would suppose mediocrity to be the sum of
all villainies, and that the mediocre man was continually
plotting in the night watches against the
innocent man of genius; and yet what has the
mediocre man done to deserve this detestation?
Poor fellow, he has no malice in him! His mediocrity
is only an afterthought. He has done his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
level best; his misfortune is that several million
of his fellowmen have done as well.</p>

<p>The superior man, especially if his eminence
be accidental, is likely to get a false notion of
those who stand on the level below him. The
biographer of an English dignitary says that the
subject of his memoir was not really haughty,
but “he was apt to be prejudiced against any one
who seemed to be afraid of him.” This is a not
uncommon kind of prejudice; and in nine cases
out of ten it is unfounded. The great man should
remember that most of those whose manners seem
unduly respectful mean nothing personal.</p>

<p>As great Pompey passes through the streets of
Rome, he may be pardoned for thinking meanly
of the people. They appear to be a subservient
lot, with no proper interests of their own, their
happiness dependent on his passing smile,—and
he knows how little that is worth. He sees them
at a disadvantage. Let him leave his triumphal
chariot, and, in the guise of Third Citizen, fall
into friendly chat with First Citizen and Second
Citizen, and his prejudices will be corrected. He
will find that these worthy men have a much
more independent and self-respecting point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
view than he had thought possible. They are out
for a holiday; they are critics of a spectacle, easily
pleased, they will admit; but if no one except
Pompey is to be seen to-day, why not make the
most of him? Pompey or Cæsar, it matters not;
“the play’s the thing.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The origin of some of our prejudices must be
sought in the childhood of the race. There are
certain opinions which have come down from the
cave-dwellers without revision. They probably at
one time had reasons to justify them, though we
have no idea what they were. There are others,
which seem equally ancient, which originated in
the forgotten experiences of our own childhood.
The prehistoric age of myth and fable does not
lie far behind any one of us. It is as if Gulliver
had been educated in Lilliput, and, while he had
grown in stature, had never quite emancipated
himself from the Lilliputian point of view. The
great hulking fellow is always awkwardly trying
to look up at things which he has actually outgrown.
He tries to make himself believe that
his early world was as big as it seemed. Sometimes
he succeeds in his endeavors, and the result
is a curious inversion of values.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Morley, in speaking of Lord Palmerston’s
foreign policy, says: “The Sultan’s ability to
speak French was one of the odd reasons why
Lord Palmerston was sanguine of Turkish civilization.”
This association of ideas in the mind
of the Prime Minister does seem odd till we
remember that before Lord Palmerston was in
the cabinet he was in the nursery. The fugitive
impressions of early childhood reappear in many
curious shapes. Who would be so hard-hearted
as to exorcise these guiltless ghosts?</p>

<p>Sometimes, in reopening an old book over
which long ago we had dreamed, we come upon
the innocent source of some of our long-cherished
opinions. Such discovery I made in the old
Family Bible when opening at the pages inserted
by the publisher between the Old Testament and
the Apocrypha. On many a Sunday afternoon
my stated hour of Bible reading was diversified
by excursions into these uncanonical pages.
There was a sense of stolen pleasure in the heap
of miscellaneous secularities. It was like finding
under the church roof a garret in which one might
rummage at will. Here were tables of weights and
measures, explanations about shekels, suggestions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in regard to the probable length of a cubit, curious
calculations as to the number of times the
word “and” occurred in the Bible. Here, also,
was a mysterious “Table of Offices and Conditions
of Men.”</p>

<p>I am sure that my scheme of admirations, my
conception of the different varieties of human
grandeur, has been colored by that “Table of
Offices and Conditions of Men.” It was my
“Social Register” and Burke’s “Peerage” and
“Who’s Who?” all in one. It was a formidable
list, beginning with the patriarchs, and ending
with the deacons. The dignity of the deacon I
already knew, for my uncle was one, but his
function was vastly exalted when I thought of
him in connection with the mysterious personages
who went before. There was the “Tirshatha,
a governor appointed by the kings of Assyria,”—evidently
a very great man. Then there were the
“Nethinims, whose duty it was to draw water
and to cleave wood.” When I was called upon
to perform similar services I ventured to think
that I myself, had I lived in better days, might
have been recognized as a sort of Nethinim.</p>

<p>Here, also, I learned the exact age of the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
not announced arbitrarily, but with the several
items all set down, so that I might have verified
them for myself, had I been mathematically
gifted. “The whole sum and number of years
from the beginning of the world unto the present
year of our Lord 1815 is 5789 years, six months,
and the said odd ten days.” I have no prejudice
in favor of retaining that chronology as far as the
thousands are concerned. Five thousand years is
one way of saying it was a very long time. If the
geologists prefer to convey the same idea by calling
it millions, I am content; but I should hate
to give up the “said odd ten days.”</p>

<p>From the same Table of Offices and Conditions
I imbibed my earliest philosophical prejudices;
for there I learned the difference between
the Stoics and the Epicureans.</p>

<p>The Stoics were described succinctly as “those
who denied the liberty of the will.” Just what
this might mean was not clear, but it had an ugly
sound. The Stoics were evidently contentious
persons. On the other hand, all that was revealed
concerning the Epicureans was that they “placed
all happiness in pleasure.” This seemed an eminently
sensible idea. I could not but be favorably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
disposed toward people who managed to get
happiness out of their pleasures.</p>

<p>To the excessive brevity of these definitions I
doubtless owe an erroneous impression concerning
that ancient, and now almost extinct people,
the Samaritans. The name has had to me a suggestion
of a sinister kind of scholarship, as if the
Samaritans had been connected with some of the
black arts. Yet I know nothing in their history
to justify this impression. The source of the error
was revealed when I turned again to the “Table
of Offices and Conditions of Men” and read once
more, “Samaritans, mongrel professors, half heathen
and half Jew.” How was I to know that the
reference was to professors of religion, and not to
professors of the arts and sciences?</p>

<p>As there are prejudices which begin in verbal
misunderstandings, so there are those which are
nourished by the accidental collocation of words.
A noun is known by the adjectives it keeps.
When we hear of dull conservatism, rabid radicalism,
selfish culture, timid piety, smug respectability,
we receive unfavorable impressions. We
do not always stop to consider that all that is
objectionable really inheres in the qualifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
words. In a well-regulated mind, after every such
verbal turn there should be a call to change partners.
Let every noun take a new adjective, and
every verb a new adverb.</p>

<p>Clever Bohemians, having heard so much of
“smug respectability,” take a dislike to respectability.
But some of the smuggest persons are not
respectable at all,—far from it! Serenely satisfied
with their own irresponsibility, they look patronizingly
upon the struggling world that owes them
a living. I remember a visit from one of these
gentry. He called to indicate his willingness to
gratify my charitable impulses by accepting from
me a small loan. If I did not believe the story of
his frequent incarcerations I might consult the
chaplain of the House of Correction. He evidently
considered that he had a mission. He went
about offering his hard and impenitent heart as
a stone on which the philanthropists might whet
their zeal. Smug respectability, forsooth!</p>

<p>From force of habit we speak of the “earnest”
reformer, and we are apt to be intolerant of his
lighter moods. Wilberforce encountered this prejudice
when he enlivened one of his speeches
with a little mirth. His opponent seized the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
opportunity to speak scornfully of the honorable
gentleman’s “religious facetiousness.” Wilberforce
replied very justly that “a religious man
might sometimes be facetious, seeing that the
irreligious did not always escape being dull.”</p>

<p>An instance of the growth of a verbal prejudice
is that which in certain circles resulted in the
preaching against what was called “mere morality.”
What the preachers had in mind was true
enough. They objected to <i>mere</i> morality, as one
might say, “Mere life is not enough to satisfy us,
we must have something to live on.” They would
have more than a bare morality. It should be
clothed with befitting spiritual raiment. But the
parson’s zeal tended to outrun his discretion, and
forgetting that the true object of his attack was
the mereness and not the morality, he gave the
impression that the Moral Man was the great
enemy of the faith. At last the parishioner would
turn upon his accuser. “You need not point the
finger of scorn at me. What if I have done my
duty to the best of my ability! You should not
twit on facts. If it comes to that, you are not in
a position to throw stones. If I am a moral man,
you’re another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>There are prejudices which are the result of
excessive fluency of speech. The flood of words
sweeps away all the natural distinctions of
thought. All things are conceived of under two
categories,—the Good and the Bad. If one ill
is admitted, it is assumed that all the rest follow
in its train. There are persons who cannot mention
“the poor” without adding, “the weak, the
wretched, the oppressed, the downtrodden, the
suffering, the sick, the sinful, the erring,” and so
on to the end of the catalogue. This is very disconcerting
to a young fellow who, while in the
best of health and spirits, is conscious that he is
rather poor. He would willingly admit his poverty
were it not for the fear of being smothered
under the wet blanket of universal commiseration.</p>

<p>When the category of the Good is adopted
with the same undiscriminating ardor the results
are equally unfortunate. We are prejudiced
against certain persons whom we have never
met. We have heard nothing but good of them,
and we have heard altogether too much of that.
Their characters have been painted in glaring
virtues that swear at one another. We are sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
that we should not like such a combination of
unmitigated excellencies, for human nature abhors
a paragon. And yet the too highly commended
person may, in reality, not be a paragon
at all, but a very decent fellow. He would quickly
rise in our regard were it not for the eulogies
which hang like millstones around his neck.</p>

<p>It is no easy thing to praise another in such a
way as to leave a good impression on the mind
of the hearer. A virtue is not for all times. When
a writer is too highly commended for being laborious
and conscientious we are not inclined to
buy his book. His conscience doth make cowards
of us all. It may be proper to recommend a candidate
for a vacant pulpit as indefatigable in his
pastoral labors; but were you to add, in the goodness
of your heart, that he was equally indefatigable
as a preacher, he would say, “An enemy
hath done this.” For the congregation would suspect
that his freedom from fatigue in the pulpit
was likely to be gained at their expense.</p>

<p>The prejudices which arise from verbal association
are potent in preventing any impartial judgment
of men whose names have become household
words. The man whose name has become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the designation of a party or a theory is the helpless
victim of his own reputation. Who takes
the trouble to pry into the personal opinions of
John Calvin? Of course they were Calvinistic.
When we hear of the Malthusian doctrine about
population, we picture its author as a cold-blooded,
economical Herod, who would gladly
have ordered a massacre of the innocents. Let
no one tell us that the Reverend Richard Malthus
was an amiable clergyman, who was greatly
beloved by the small parish to which he ministered.
In spite of all his church wardens might
say, we would not trust our children in the hands
of a man who had suggested that there might be
too many people in the world. But in such cases
we should remember that a man’s theories do not
always throw light upon his character. When a
distinguished physician has a disease named after
him, it is understood that the disease is the one
he discovered, and not the one he died of.</p>

<p>When the Darwinian hypothesis startled the
world, many pious imaginations conceived definite
pictures of the author of it. These pictures
had but one thing in common,—their striking
unlikeness to the quiet gentleman who had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
all this stir. By the way, Darwin was the innocent
victim of two totally disconnected lines of
prejudice. After he had outlived the disfavor of
the theologians, he incurred the contempt of the
apostles of Culture; all because of his modest
confession that he did not enjoy poetry as much
as he once did. Unfortunately, his scientific habit
of mind led him to say that he suspected that he
might be suffering from atrophy of the imaginative
faculty. Instantly every literal-minded reader
and reviewer exclaimed, “How dreadful! What
a judgment on him!” Yet, when we stop to
think about it, the affliction is not so uncommon
as to call for astonishment. Many persons suffer
from it who are not addicted to science.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>After all, these are harmless prejudices. They
are content with their own little spheres; they ask
only to live and let live. There are others, however,
that are militantly imperialistic. They are
ambitious to become world powers. Such are
those which grow out of differences in politics,
in religion, and in race.</p>

<p>Political animosities have doubtless been mitigated
by freer social intercourse, which gives more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
opportunities for meeting on neutral ground. It
is only during a heated campaign that we think
of all of the opposing party as rascals. There is
time between elections to make the necessary
exceptions. It is customary to make allowance
for a certain amount of partisan bias, just as the
college faculty allows a student a certain number
of “cuts.” It is a just recognition of human
weakness.</p>

<p>Our British cousins go farther, and provide
means for the harmless gratification of natural
prejudices. There are certain questions on which
persons are expected to express themselves with
considerable fervor, and without troubling themselves
as to the reasonableness of their contention.
In a volume of published letters I was pleased
to read one from a member of the aristocracy.
He had been indulging in trivial personalities,
when suddenly he broke off with “Now I must
go to work on the Wife’s Sister’s Question; I
intend to make a good stout protest against that
rascally bill!” There is no such exercise for the
moral nature as a good stout protest. We Americans
take our exercise spasmodically. Instead
of going about it regularly, we wait for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
extraordinary occasion. We make it a point of
sportsmanship to shoot our grievance on the
wing, and we are nervously anxious lest it get
out of range before we have time to take aim.</p>

<p>Not so the protesting Briton. He approves of
the answer of Jonah when he was asked, “Doest
thou well to be angry for the gourd?” Jonah,
without any waste of words, replied, “I do well
to be angry.” When the Englishman feels that
it is well for him to be angry, he finds constitutional
means provided. Parliament furnishes a
number of permanent objects for his disapproval.
Whenever he feels disposed he can make a good
stout protest, feeling assured that his indignation
is well bestowed. He has such satisfaction as
that which came to Mr. Micawber in reading his
protest against the villainies of Uriah Heep:
“Much afflicted but still intensely enjoying himself,
Mr. Micawber folded up the letter and
handed it with a bow to my aunt, as something
she might like to keep.”</p>

<p>These stout-hearted people have learned not
only how to take their pleasures sadly, but, what
is more to the purpose, how to take their sadnesses
pleasantly. We Americans have, here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
something to learn. We should get along better
if we had a number of argument-proof questions
like that in regard to marriage with the deceased
wife’s sister which could be warranted to recur at
regular intervals. They could be set apart as a
sort of public playground for the prejudices. It
would at least keep the prejudices out of mischief.</p>

<p>Religious prejudice has an air of singularity.
The singular thing is that there should be such
a variety. If we identify religion with the wisdom
that is from above, and which is “first pure,
then peaceable, easy to be entreated, without
partiality,” it is hard to see where the prejudice
comes in. Religious prejudice is a compound of
religion and several decidedly earthly passions.
The combination produces a peculiarly dangerous
explosive. The religious element has the
same part in it that the innocent glycerine has in
nitro-glycerine. This latter, we are told, is “a
compound produced by the action of a mixture
of strong nitric and sulphuric acids on glycerine
at low temperatures.” It is observable that in the
making of religious prejudice the religion is kept
at a very low temperature, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>We are at present in an era of good feeling.
Not only is there an interchange of kindly offices
between members of different churches, but one
may detect a tendency to extend the same tolerance
to the opposing party in the same church.
This is a real advance, for it is always more difficult
to do justice to those who differ from us
slightly than to those whose divergence is fundamental.
To love our friends is a work of nature,
to love our enemies is a work of grace; the
troublesome thing is to get on with those who
are “betwixt and between.” In such a case we
are likely to fall between nature and grace as between
two stools. Almost any one can be magnanimous
in great affairs, but to be magnanimous
in trifles is like trying to use a large screw-driver
to turn a small screw.</p>

<p>In a recently published correspondence between
dignitaries of the Church of England I
find many encouraging symptoms. The writers
exhibit a desire to do justice not only to the
moral, but also to the intellectual, gifts of those
who differ from them even slightly. There is, of
course, enough of the old Adam remaining to
make their judgments on one another interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
reading. It is pleasant to see brethren dwelling
together in unity,—a pleasure seldom prolonged
to the point of satiety. Thus the Dean of Norwich
writes to the Dean of Durham in regard to
Dean Stanley. Alluding to an opinion, in a previous
letter, in regard to Archbishop Tait, the
writer says: “I confess I shouldn’t have ranked
him among the great men of the day. Of our
contemporaries I should have assigned that rank,
without hesitation, to little Stan, though I quite
think he did more mischief in our church and to
religion than most men have it in them to do.
Still I should say that little Stan was a great man
in his way.” There you may see a mind that has,
with considerable difficulty, uprooted a prejudice,
though you may still perceive the place where
the prejudice used to be.</p>

<p>While the methods of the exact sciences have
had a discouraging effect on partisan and sectarian
prejudices, they seem, for the moment, to have
given new strength to those which are the result
of differences in race. Time was when Anti-Semitism
derived its power from religious rancor.
The cradle hymn which the Puritan mother sang
began sweetly,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">

<p>But after a while the mother thinks of the wickedness

</div>


<p>In these days, the Anti-Semites are not so
likely to be angry while they sing, as while they
cast up their accounts.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The natural sciences discriminate between
classes rather than between individuals. Sociology
deals with groups, and not with persons. Anthropology
acquaints us with the aboriginal and unmoralized
man. It emphasizes the solidarity of
the clan and the persistence of the cult. Experimental
psychology is at present interested in the
sub-conscious and instinctive life. For its purpose
it treats a man as a series of nervous reactions.
Human history is being rewritten as a branch of
Natural History. Eliminating the part played by
personal will, it exhibits an age-long warfare between
nations and races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>This is all very well so long as we remember
what it is that we are studying. Races, cults, and
social groups exist and have their history. There
is no harm in defining the salient characteristics
of a race, and saying that, on the whole, one race
is inferior to another. The difficulty comes when
this rough average is made the dead line beyond
which an individual is not allowed to pass.</p>

<p>In our Comedy of Errors, which is always slipping
into tragedy, there are two Dromios on the
stage,—the Race and the Individual. The Race
is an abstraction which can bear any amount of
punishment without flinching. You may say anything
you please about it and not go far wrong.
It is like criticising a composite photograph.
There is nothing personal about it. Who is
offended at the caricatures of Brother Jonathan
or of John Bull? We recognize certain persistent
national traits, but we also recognize the element
of good-humored exaggeration. The Jew,
the Slav, the Celt, the Anglo-Saxon have existed
for ages. Each has admired himself, and been
correspondingly disliked by others. Even the
Negro as a racial abstraction is not sensitive. You
may, if you will, take up the text, so much quoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
a generation ago, “Cursed be Canaan; a servant
of servants shall he be.... God shall enlarge
Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
and Canaan shall be his servant.” Dromio Africanus
listens unmoved to the exegesis of Petroleum
V. Nasby and his compeers at the Crossroads:
“God cust Canaan, and sed he shood be a servant
forever. Did he mean us to pay him wages?
Not eny: for ef he hed he wood hev ordered
our tastes and habits so es we shood hev hed
the wherewithal to do it.”</p>

<p>The impassive Genius of Africa answers the
Anglo-Saxon: “If it pleases you to think that
your prejudice against me came out of the Ark,
so be it. If you find it agreeable to identify yourself
with Japheth who shall providentially be
enlarged, I may as well be Canaan.”</p>

<p>So long as the doctrinaires of the Crossroads
are dealing only with highly generalized conceptions
no harm is done. But now another Dromio
appears. He is not a race; he is a person. He
has never come that way before, and he is bewildered
by what he sees and hears. Immediately he
is beset by those who accuse him of crimes which
some one who looks like him has committed. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
is beaten because he does not know his place;
how can he know it, stumbling as he does upon
a situation for which he is altogether unprepared?
It is an awkward predicament, this of being born
into the world as a living soul. Under the most
favorable conditions it is hard for the new arrival
to find himself, and adjust himself to his environment.
But this victim of mistaken identity
finds that he has been judged and condemned
already. When he innocently tries to make the
most of himself a great uproar is created. What
right has he to interfere with the preconceived
opinions of his betters? They understand him,
for have they not known him for many generations?</p>

<p>Poor man Dromio! Whether he have a black
skin or a yellow, and whatever be the racial type
which his features suggest, the trouble is the same.
He is sacrificed on the altar of our stupidity.
He suffers because of our mental color-blindness,
which prevents our distinguishing persons. We
see only groups, and pride ourselves on our defective
vision. By and by we may learn to be a
little ashamed of our crudely ambitious generalizations.
A finer gift is the ability to know a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
when we see him. It may be that Nature is
“careful of the type,” and “careless of the single
life.” If that be so, it may be the part of wisdom
for us to give up some of our anxieties about the
type, knowing that Nature will take care of that.
Such relief from excessive cosmic responsibility
will give us much more time for our proper work,
which is to deal justly with each single life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c4">HOW TO KNOW THE FALLACIES</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>Y friend Scholasticus was in a bad way.
He had been educated before the elective
system came in, and he had a pathetic veneration
for the old curriculum. It was to him the sacred
ark, now, alas, carried away into the land of the
Philistines. He cherished it as a sort of creed
containing the things surely to be learned by a
gentleman, and whoso hath not learned these
things, let him be anathema. In meeting the
present-day undergraduates, it was hard to say
which amazed him most, the things they knew
or the things they did not know. Perhaps the
new knowledge seemed to him the more uncouth.</p>

<p>“The intellectual world,” he would say, “is
topsy-turvy. What is to be expected of a generation
that learns to write before it learns to read,
and learns to read before it learns to spell,—or
rather which never does learn to spell. Everything
begins wrong end foremost. In my day small children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
were supposed to be ‘pleased with a rattle,
tickled with a straw,’ until such time as they were
old enough to be put to stiff work on the First
Reader. Nowadays, the babes begin with the
esoteric doctrine of their playthings. Even the
classics of infancy are rationalized. I was about to
buy a copy of ‘Mother Hubbard and her Dog’
for a dear young friend, when I discovered that it
was a revised version. The most stirring incident
was given thus,—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She went to the baker’s to buy some bread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when she came back the dog looked dead.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>That wasn’t the way the tale was told to me. I
was told that the poor dog was dead, and I believed
it. That didn’t prevent my believing a
little while after that the doggie was dancing a jig.
I took it for granted that that was the way dogs
did in Mother Hubbard’s day. Nowadays, the
critics in bib and tucker insist that the story must
conform to what they have prematurely learned
about the invariable laws of nature.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind this if they kept on reasoning.
But it’s a false start. After the wide generalizations
of infancy have been forgotten, the
youth begins to specialize. He takes a small slice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of a subject, ignoring its more obvious features
and its broader outlines. He has a contempt for
general ideas. What we studied, he takes for
granted. He’s very observing, but he doesn’t
put two and two together. There they stand in
his mind, two separate ideas, politely ignoring one
another, because they have not been properly introduced.
The result of all this is evident enough.
How many people do you come across with
whom it is a pleasure to hold an argument? Not
many! They don’t know the rules of the game.
You can’t enter a drawing-room without hearing
questions discussed in a way possible only to those
whose early education in the art of reasoning had
been neglected. The chances are that every one
of the fallacies we learned about in Whately could
appear in good society without anybody being
able to call them by their Latin names.</p>

<p>“‘Doesn’t this follow from that?’ the facile
talker asks, as if that were all that is necessary to
constitute a valid argument. Of course it follows;
his assertions follow one another like a flock of
sheep. But what short work our old Professor
would have made with these plausible sequences!</p>

<p>“What a keen scent the old man had for fallacies!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Even when the conclusion was obviously
sound, he insisted that we should come by it honestly.
He would never admit that in such matters
the end justifies the means. I remember his
merciless exposure of the means by which some
unscrupulous metaphysicians accumulated their
intellectual property. His feeling about the ‘Undistributed
Middle’ was much the same as that
of Henry George about the ‘Unearned Increment.’
How he used to get after the moonshiners
who were distilling arguments by the illicit process
of the major term! In these days the illicit
process goes on openly. The growth of the real
sciences does not in the least discourage the pseudo-sciences.
It rather seems to stimulate them.</p>

<p>“For many persons, a newly discovered fact is
simply a spring-board from which they dive into
a bottomless sea of speculation. They pride
themselves on their ability to jump at conclusions,
forgetting that jumping is an exercise in which
the lower orders excel their betters. If an elephant
could jump as far, in proportion to his
weight, as a flea, there would be no holding him
on the planet. Every new discovery is followed
by a dozen extravagances, engineered by the Get-wise-quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
people. There is always some Young
Napoleon of Philosophy who undertakes to corner
the truth-market. It’s like what happened at
the opening of Oklahoma Territory. Before the
day set by the government when they all were to
start fair in their race for farms, a band of adventurers
called ‘Sooners’ smuggled themselves
across the line. When the <i>bona fide</i> settler arrived
on his quarter-section, he found an impudent
Sooner in possession. You can’t find any
fresh field of investigation that isn’t claimed by
these Sooners. It all comes because people are
no longer educated logically.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>When Scholasticus was in this mood, it was
difficult to do anything with him. It was in vain
to tell him that he was narrow, for, like all narrow
men, he took that as a compliment. It is
the broad way, he reminded me, that leads to intellectual
destruction. Still, I attempted to bring
him to a better frame of mind.</p>

<p>“Scholasticus,” said I, “the old order changes.
You are a survivor of another period. You were
educated according to a logical order. You
learned to spell out of a Spelling Book, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
read out of a Reader, and to write not by following
the dictates of your own conscience, but
by following the copy in a Copy Book; and
you learned to speak correctly by committing to
memory the rules of grammar and afterwards the
exceptions.”</p>

<p>“And it was a good way, too,” interrupted
Scholasticus. “It gave us a respect for law and
order, to learn the rules and to abide by them.
Now, I understand, they don’t have grammar, but
‘language work.’ The idea is, I suppose, that if
the pupils practice the exceptions they needn’t
bother about the rules. When I studied geography,
we began with a definition of the word geography,
after which we were told that the earth
is a planet, and that three fourths of its surface
is water, a fact which I have never forgotten.
Nowadays they hold that geography, like charity,
should begin at home, so the first thing is to make
a geodetic survey of the back yard. By the time
they work up to the fact that the earth is a planet,
the pupils have learned so many other things that
it makes very little impression on their minds.”</p>

<p>“Scholasticus,” said I, “I was saying the old
order changes lest one good custom should corrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the educational world. They were great
people for rules in your day. It was an inheritance
from the past. You remember the anecdote
of Ezekiel Cheever, head master of the Boston
Latin School, who taught Cotton Mather Latin.
A pupil writes, ‘My master found fault with the
syntax of one word, which was not so used heedlessly,
but designedly, and therefore I told him
there was a plain grammar rule for it. He angrily
replied that there was no such rule. I took the
grammar and showed the rule to him. Then he
said, “Thou art a brave boy. I had forgot the
rule.”’ That takes us back to a time when there
was a superstitious reverence for rules. We don’t
reason so rigidly from rules now, we develop the
mind according to a chronological rather than a
logical order. We let the ideas come according
to the order of nature.”</p>

<p>At this, the wrath of Scholasticus bubbled over.
“‘The order of nature’! The nature of what?
A cabbage head grows according to an order natural
to cabbages. But a rational intelligence is developed
according to the laws of reason. The first
thing is to formulate the laws, and then to obey
them. Logic has to do with the laws of rational<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
thought, just as grammar has to do with the laws
of correct speech. Nowadays, the teacher seems
to be afraid of laying down the law. I visited a
model school the other day. It wasn’t a school
at all, according to the definition in the old-fashioned
book I used to read: ‘A school is a place
where children go to study books. The good
children when they have learned their lessons go
out to play, the idle remain and are punished.’
According to the modern method, it is the teacher
who must remain to be punished for the idleness
of her pupils. It’s her business to make the lessons
interesting. If their attention wanders, she
is held responsible. The teacher must stay after
hours and plan new strategic moves. She must
‘by indirections find directions out,’—while the
pupil is resisting one form of instruction, she suddenly
teaches him something else. In this way
the pupil’s wits are kept on the run. No matter
how they scatter, there is the teacher before
him.”</p>

<p>“Why is not that a good way?” I said. “It
certainly brings results. The pupil gets on rapidly.
He learns a lesson before he knows it.”</p>

<p>“He never does know it,” growled Scholasticus.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
“And what’s worse, he doesn’t know that
he doesn’t know it. By this painless method he
has never been compelled to charge his mind
with it and to reason it out. And besides, it’s
death on the teacher. Ezekiel Cheever taught
that Boston Latin School till he was over ninety
years old, and never had a touch of nervous prostration.
He didn’t have to lie awake planning
how to hold the rapt attention of his pupils. If
there was any chance of the grammar rules not
being learned, he let them do the worrying. It
was good for them. There was a race of sturdy
thinkers in those days. They knew how to deal
with knotty problems. If they survived the school,
they could not be downed in the town meeting.”</p>

<p>“Scholasticus,” I said, “I don’t like the way
you talk. The trouble with you is that you took
your education too hard. I fancy that I see every
lesson you ever learned sticking out of your consciousness
like the piles of stones in a New Hampshire
pasture. They are monuments of industry,
but they lack a certain suavity. You are doing
what most Americans do,—whenever they find
anything wrong they lay the blame on the public
schools. Just because some of the younger men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
at your club argue somewhat erratically, you
blame the whole modern system of education.
It’s a way you clever people have,—you are not
content with one good and sufficient reason for
your statement of fact. You must reinforce it by
another of a more general character. It makes me
feel as I do when, a faucet needing a new washer,
I send for a plumber,—and behold twain! One
would be enough, if he would attend strictly to
business. Every system has its failures. If that
of the present day seems to have more than its
share, it is because its failures are still in evidence,
while those of your generation are mostly forgotten.
Oblivion is a deft housemaid, who tidies up
the chambers of the Past, by sweeping all the
dust into the dark corners. On the other hand,
you drop into the Present amid the disorder of
the spring cleaning, when everything is out on
the line. If you could recall the shining lights in
your Logic class, you might admit that some of
them had the form of reasoning without the power
thereof. It was in your day, wasn’t it, that the criticism
was made on the undergraduate thesis:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Although he wrote it all by rote,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He did not write it right.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>
<p>I couldn’t help thinking of those lines when I was
listening just now to your reasoning. The real
point, Scholasticus, is this, which seems to have
escaped you. You talk of the laws of the mind.
When you were in college it seemed a very simple
thing to formulate these laws. There was no
Child Psychology, giving way before you knew
it to Adolescence, where everything was quite different.
There was no talk about subliminal consciousness,
where you couldn’t tell which was
consciousness and which was something else. The
mind in your day came in one standard size.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Scholasticus, “when we were in
the Academy, we had Watts on the Mind. Watts
treated his subject in a straightforward way; he
had nothing about nervous reactions; he gave us
plain Mind. When we got into college we had
Locke on the Understanding. When it was time
to take account of conscience, we had Paley’s
‘Moral Science.’ This, with the ‘Evidences,’ made
a pretty good preparation for life.”</p>

<p>“So it did,” I said, “and you have done credit
to your training. But since that time Psychologists
have made a number of discoveries which
render it necessary to revise the old methods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>Seeing that he, for the first time, was giving
me his attention, I thought that it might be possible
to win him away from that futile and acrid
criticism of the present course of events, which is
the besetting sin of men of his age, to the more
fruitful criticism by creation.</p>

<p>“Scholasticus,” I said, “here is your opportunity.
You complain that Logic is going out.
The trouble is that it has been taught in an antiquated
way. The logicians followed the analogy
of mathematics. They invented all sorts of formal
figures and diagrams, and were painfully abstract.
When you were learning to reason, you had to
commit to memory a formula like this: ‘Every
y is x; every z is y; therefore every z is x. <i>E.g.</i>,
let the major term (which is represented by x) be
“One who possesses all virtue,” the minor term
(z) “Every man who possesses one virtue,” and
the middle term (y) “Every man who possesses
prudence,” and you have the celebrated argument
of Aristotle that “the virtues are inseparable.”’</p>

<p>“Now you can’t make the youth of this generation
submit to that kind of argumentation.
They are willing to admit the virtues are inseparable,
if you say so, but they are not going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
take time to figure it out. You can’t arouse their
interest by demonstrating that ‘If A is B, C is D,
C is not D, therefore A is not B.’ They say,
‘What of it?’ They refuse to concern themselves
about the fate of letters of the alphabet.
Such methods prejudice them against Logic.
They prefer not to reason at all, rather than do it
in such an old-fashioned way. Besides, they have
peeped into the Psychology for Teachers, and
they know their rights. Such teaching is not good
pedagogics. The youthful mind must be shielded
from abstractions; if it is not, there’s no knowing
what might happen. It will not do to go at your
subject in such a brutal way. This is the age of
the concrete and the vital. Things are observed
in the state of nature. The birds must be in the
bush, and the fishes in the water, and the flowers
must be caught in the very act of growing.
That’s what makes them interesting. If the
youthful mind is to be induced to love Nature,
Nature must do her prettiest for the youthful
mind. Otherwise it will be found that the mental
vacuum abhors Nature.</p>

<p>“If there is to be a revival of Logic, it must
be attached to something in which people are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
already interested. People are interested in biological
processes. They like to see things grow,
and to help in the process as far as they can without
disturbing Nature. Why don’t you, Scholasticus,
try your hand at a text-book which shall
insinuate a sufficient knowledge of the principles
of sound reasoning, under the guise of Botany
or Hygiene or Physical Culture, or some of the
branches that are more popular? I believe that
you could make a syllogism as interesting as anything
else. All you have to do is to make people
think that it is something else.”</p>

<p>At the time Scholasticus only sniffed scornfully
at my suggestion; but not many days had passed
before I began to notice a change in his demeanor.
Instead of his usual self-sufficiency, there came
into his eyes a wistful plea for appreciation. He
had the chastened air of one who no longer sits
in the chair of the critic, but is awaiting the moment
when he shall endure criticism.</p>

<p>From such signs as these I inferred that Scholasticus
was writing a book. There is nothing
that so takes the starch out of a man’s intellect
and reduces him to a state of abject dependence
on the judgment of his fellow beings as writing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
book. For the first question about a book is not,
“Is it good?” but, “Will anybody read it?”
When this question is asked, the most commonplace
individual assumes a new importance. He
represents the Public. The Author wonders as to
what manner of man he is. Will he like the Book?</p>

<p>I was not therefore surprised when one day
Scholasticus, in a shamefaced way, handed me
the manuscript of a work entitled, “How to Know
the Fallacies; or Nature-Study in Logic.”</p>

<p>In these pages Scholasticus shows a sincere
desire to adapt himself to a new order of things.
He no longer stands proudly on the quarter-deck
of the good ship Logic, with a sense of fathomless
depths of rationality under the keel. Logic is a
poor old stranded wreck. His work is like that
of the Swiss Family Robinson: to carry off the
necessities of life and the more portable luxuries,
and to use them in setting up housekeeping on
the new island of Nature-Study.</p>

<p>I cannot say that he has been entirely successful
in making the art of reasoning a pleasant out-of-door
recreation. He has not altogether overcome
the stiffness which is the result of his early
education. In treating thought as if it were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
vegetable, he does not always conceal the fact
that it is <i>not</i> a vegetable. There are, therefore,
occasional jolts as he suddenly changes from one
aspect of his subject to another.</p>

<p>I was, however, much pleased to see that, instead
of ambitiously attempting to treat of the
processes of valid reasoning, he has been content
to begin with those forms of argumentation which
are more familiar.</p>

<p>His preface does what every good preface
should do: it presents the Author not at his worst
nor at his best, but in a salvable condition, so that
the reader will say, “He is not such a bad fellow,
after all, and doubtless when he gets warmed up
to his work he will do better.” It may be as
well to quote the Preface in full.</p>

<p>“Careless Reader, in the intervals between
those wholesome recreations which make up the
more important portion of life, you may have
sometimes come upon a thought. It may have
been only a tiny thoughtlet. Slight as it was in
itself, it was worthy of your attention, for it was
a living thing. Pushing its way out of the fertile
soil of your subconscious being, it had come
timidly into the light of day. If it seemed to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
unusual, it was only because you have not cultivated
the habit of noticing such things. They are
really very common.</p>

<p>“If you can spare the time, let us sit down together
and pluck up the thoughtlet by the roots
and examine its structure. You may find some
pleasure, and perhaps a little profit, in these native
growths of your mind.</p>

<p>“When you take up a thought and pull it to
pieces, you will see that it is not so simple as it
seems. It is in reality made up of several thoughts
joined together. When you try to separate them,
you find it difficult. The connective tissue which
binds them together is called inference. When
several thoughts growing out of the same soil are
connected by inference, they form what is called
an argument. Arguments, as they are found in
the state of Nature, are of two kinds; those that
hang together, and those that only seem to hang
together; these latter are called Fallacies.</p>

<p>“In former times they were treated as mere
weeds and were mercilessly uprooted. In these
days we have learned to look upon them with a
kindlier eye. They have their uses, and serve to
beautify many a spot that otherwise would remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
barren. They are the wild flowers of the intellectual
world. I do not intend to intrude my own
taste or to pass judgment on the different varieties;
but only to show my readers how to know
the fallacies when they see them. It may be said
that mere nomenclature is of little value. So it
is in itself; yet there is a pleasure in knowing the
names of the common things we meet every day.
The search for fallacies need never take one far
afield. The collector may find almost all the
known varieties growing within his own enclosure.</p>

<p>“Let us then go out in the sunshine into the
pleasant field of thought. There we see the arguments—valid
and otherwise—as they are growing.
You will notice that every argument has
three essential parts. First is the root, called by
the old logicians in their crabbed language the
Major Premise. Growing quite naturally out of
this is the stem, called the Minor Premise; and
crowning that is the flower, with its seed vessels
which contain the potentialities of future arguments,—this
is called the Conclusion.</p>

<p>“Let the reader observe this argument: ‘Every
horse is an animal;’ that is the root thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
‘Sheep are not horses;’ that is the stem shooting
into the air. ‘Therefore, sheep are not animals;’
that is the conclusion, the full corn in the ear.</p>

<p>“There is a pleasing impression of naturalness
about the way in which one thought grows out of
that which immediately preceded it. There is a
sudden thrill when we come to the ‘therefore,’
the blossoming time of the argument. We feel
that we are entering into one of Nature’s secret
processes. Unless our senses are deceiving us, we
are actually reasoning.</p>

<p>“After a while, when curiosity and the pride of
possession lead us to look more carefully at our
treasure, we are somewhat surprised. It is not as
it seemed. A little observation convinces us that,
in spite of our argumentation, sheep are animals,
and always have been. Thus, quite by accident,
and through the unaided exercise of our own faculties,
we have come upon one of the most ancient
forms of reasoning, one that has engaged
the attention of wise men since Aristotle,—a fallacy.”</p>

<p>In the opening chapters, Scholasticus gives a
description of the more common fallacies, with
an account of their habits of growth and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
soils in which they most flourish. “<i>Petitio Principii</i>,
or begging the question. This is a very pretty
little fallacy of vine-like habit. It is found growing
beside old walls, and wherever it is not likely
to be disturbed. It is easily propagated from slips,
each slip being capable of indefinite multiplication,
the terminal buds sending down new roots,
and the process of growth going on continuously.
So tenacious is it that it is practically impossible
to eradicate the <i>petitio</i>, when once it has fairly
established itself. It recommends itself on the
ground of economy. In most arguments the attempt
is made to prove one thing by means of
another thing. This, of course, involves a considerable
waste of good material. In begging the
question, by means of one proposition we are
enabled to prove a proposition that is identical
with it. In this way an idea may be made to go
a long way.</p>

<p>“The most familiar variety of this fallacy is that
known as the Argument in a Circle. To those
who are fond of arguments, but who can afford
very little mind space for their cultivation, this
is an almost ideal fallacy. It requires only the
slightest soil, deriving its nutriment almost wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
from the air, and reproducing itself without the
slightest variation in type.</p>

<p>“Its hardiness and exuberant efflorescence
make it desirable for many purposes. It is useful as
a screen to hide the more unsightly parts of one’s
intellectual grounds. Often, too, there may be an
argumentative structure that has fallen into decay.
Its real reason for existence is no longer obvious,
yet it may have associations which make us reluctant
to tear it down. In such a case, nothing
is easier than to plant a slip of the circular argument.
In a short time the old ruin becomes a
bower, covered with an exuberant efflorescence
of rationality. This argument is to be recommended
for a Woman’s Hardy Garden of Fallacies.</p>

<p>“It is one which gives great pleasure to a home-loving
person who finds satisfaction in that which
is his own. Often have I seen a householder sitting
under its sweet shade, well content. He was
conscious of having an argument which answered
to all his needs, and which protected him alike
from the contradiction of sinners and from the
intrusive questioning of the more critical sort of
saints. He had such satisfaction as came to Jonah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
when the booth he had constructed, with such
slight skill as belonged to an itinerant preacher,
was covered by the luxuriant gourd vine. Things
were not going as he had expected in Nineveh,
and current events were discrediting his prophecies,
but Jonah ‘rejoiced with great joy over the
gourd.’</p>

<p>“I may be pardoned, in treating the circular
argument, for deviating, for a moment, from the
field of botany into the neighboring field of zoölogy.
For after all, the same principles hold good
there also, and as we are forming the habit of
looking at thought as a kind of plant, we may also
consider it as a kind of animal,—let us say, if
you please, a goldfish. You have often paused
to watch the wonders of marine life as epitomized
in a glass globe upon your centre-table. Those
who go down to the sea in ships have doubtless
seen more of the surface of waters, but they have
not the same facilities for looking into its interior
life that you have in your aquarium. A school
of goldfishes represent for you the finny monsters
of the deep. You see the whole world they move
in. The encircling glass is the firmament in the
midst of the waters. The goldfishes go round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
and round, and have a very good time, and have
many adventures, but they never get out of their
crystal firmament. You may leave them for half
a day, but when you come back you know just
where to find them. An aquarium is a much safer
place for goldfishes to swim in than the ocean;
to be sure, they do not get on far, but on the
other hand they do not get lost, and there are no
whales or even herrings, to make them afraid.
There is the same advantage in doing our reasoning
in a circle. We can keep up an argument
much longer when we are operating in friendly
waters and are always near our base of supplies.
The trouble with thinking straight is, that it is
likely to take us too far from home. The first we
know we are facing a new issue. From this peril
we are saved by the habit of going round and
round. He who argues and runs away from the
real difficulty lives to argue another day, and
the best of it is the argument will be just the
same.</p>

<p>“<i>Argumentum ad Hominem.</i> This is a large family,
containing many interesting varieties. The
<i>ad hominem</i> is of parasitic growth, a sort of logical
mistletoe. It grows not out of the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
things, but of the nature of the particular mind to
which it is addressed. In the cultivation of this
fallacy it is only necessary to remember that each
mind has its weak point. Find out what this weak
point is, and drop into it the seed of the appropriate
fallacy, and the result will exceed your fondest
anticipation.</p>

<p>“Again with the reader’s kind permission, I will
stray from the field of botany; this time into that
of personal experience. At the risk of falling into
obsolete and discredited methods of instruction, I
will ask you for the moment to look in and not
out.</p>

<p>“Dear Reader, often, when reasoning with
yourself, especially about your own conduct, you
have found comfort in a syllogism like this:—</p>

<div class="blockquot1">
<p>
I like to do right.<br>
I do what I like.<br>
Therefore, I do what is right.
</p></div>

<p>The conclusion is so satisfactory that you have
no heart to look too narrowly at the process by
which it is attained. When you do what you
like, it is pleasant to think that righteousness is a
by-product of your activity. Moreover, there is a
native generosity about you which makes you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
willing to share with others the more lasting benefits
which may ensue. You are ready to believe
that what is profitable to you must also be profitable
to them in the long run,—if not in a material,
then in a spiritual way. All the advantage
that comes to you is merely temporary and personal.
When you have reaped this scanty harvest,
you do not begrudge to humanity in general
its plentiful gleanings. In your altruistic mood
you do not consider too carefully the particular
blessing which your action has bestowed on the
world; you are content with the thought that it
is a good diffused.</p>

<p>“When out of what is in the beginning only
a personal gratification there grows a cosmic law,
we have the <i>Argumentum ad Hominem</i>. There are
few greater pleasures in life than that of having all
our preferences justified by our reason. There are
some persons who are so susceptible to arguments
of this kind that they never suffer from the sensation
of having done something wrong,—a sensation
which I can assure you is quite disagreeable.
They might suspect they had done wrong, were it
not that as soon as they begin to reason about it
they perceive that all that happened was highly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
their credit. The more they think about it, the
more pleased they are with themselves. They perceive
that their action was much more disinterested
than, at the time, they intended. They are
like a person who tumbles into the Dead Sea. He
can’t go under even if he tries. It is, of course, a
matter of specific gravity. When a conscience is
of less specific gravity than the moral element into
which it is cast, it cannot remain submerged. The
fortunate owner of such a conscience watches it
with satisfaction when it serenely bobs to the surface;
he advertises its superlative excellence,—‘Perfectly
Pure! It floats.’</p>

<p>“The great use of the <i>ad hominem</i> argument is
like that of certain leguminous plants which enrich
the soil by giving to it elements in which it
had been previously lacking. After a crop of <i>ad
hominem</i> arguments has grown and been turned
under, we may expect a rich harvest of more commercially
valuable fallacies in the next season.
To thus enrich the soil is an evidence of the skill
of the culturist.</p>

<p>“Suppose, for example, you were to attempt to
implant this proposition in the unprepared mind
of an acquaintance, ‘All geese are swans.’ The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
proposition is not well received. All your friend’s
ornithological prejudices are against it. There is
no foodstuff to support your theory.</p>

<p>“But suppose you prepare the soil by a crop of
the <i>ad hominem</i> argument. You say to your friend,
after looking admiringly at his possessions, ‘It
seems to me that all <i>your</i> geese are swans.’ He
answers cordially, ‘That’s just what I was thinking
myself.’ Now you have nicely prepared the
ground for further operations.</p>

<p>“While controversial theologians have always
had a fondness for arguments in a circle, the <i>ad
hominem</i> arguments have been largely cultivated
by politicians. More than a generation ago Jeremy
Bentham published a work called ‘Political
Fallacies.’ He described those that are indigenous
to the British Isles. Almost all on his list were
of the <i>ad hominem</i> variety. He described particularly
those which could be grown to advantage in
the Houses of Parliament. Since Bentham’s day,
much has been done in America in the way of
propagating new varieties. Many of these, though
widely advertised, have not yet been scientifically
described. I have thought that if my present book
is well received, I might publish another covering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
this ground. It will probably be entitled, ‘Reasoning
for Profit; or Success with Small Fallacies.’</p>

<p>“The great essential in arguments of this kind
is to have a thorough knowledge of the soil. Given
the right soil, and the most feeble argument
will flourish. Take, for example, the arguments
for the divine right of kings to rule, once much
esteemed by court preachers. Of course the first
necessity was to catch your kings. The arguments
in themselves were singularly feeble, but
they flourished mightily in the hotbeds of royalty.
The trouble was that they did not bear transplanting.</p>

<p>“Half a century ago there were a dozen thrifty
arguments for human slavery. They are, abstractly
speaking, as good now as they ever were, but they
have altogether passed out of cultivation.</p>

<p>“In landscape gardening groups of the <i>ad hominem</i>
arguments skillfully arranged are always
charming. Much discrimination is needed for the
adornment of any particular spot. Suppose you
were called upon to furnish fallacies for an Amalgamated
Society of Esoteric Astrologers. You
might safely, in such fertile soil and tropical climate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
plant the most luxuriant exotics. Such airy
growths, however, would be obviously inappropriate
for a commercial club composed of solid business
men. You would for them choose rather a
sturdy perennial, for example, the <i>argumentum ad
Pennsylvaniam</i>, or tariff-bearing argument.</p>

<p>“It grows thus:—</p>

<p>
The tariff is that which conduces to our prosperity.<br>
A tax does not conduce to our prosperity.<br>
Therefore, a tariff is not a tax.<br>
</p>

<p>“Persons who have confined their logical exercises
to the task of convincing impartial minds
have no idea of the exhilaration which comes when
one has only to convince a person of the wisdom
of a course of action he has already taken. There
is really no comparison between the two. There
is all the difference that there is between climbing
an icy hill and sliding down the same hill on a
toboggan. There is no intellectual sport equal to
that of tobogganing from a lofty moral premise
to a congenial practical conclusion. We go so
fast that we hardly know how we got to the bottom,
but there we are, safe and sound. We have
only to choose our company and hold on; gravitation
does the rest. It is astonishing what conclusions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>we can come to when we do our reasoning
in this pleasantly gregarious fashion.</p>

<p>“<i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>, or the fallacy of irrelevant
conclusion. This is not a natural species, but the
result of artifice. It is a familiar kind of argument.
It begins well, and it ends well, but you have a
feeling that something has happened to it in the
middle. You have noticed in the orchard an apple
tree that starts out to be a Pippin, but when the
time comes for it to bear fruit it has apparently
changed its mind, and has concluded to be a
Rhode Island Greening. Of course you are aware
that it has not really changed its mind, for the
laws of Nature are quite invariable. The whimsicality
of its conduct is to be laid not upon Nature,
but upon Art. The gardener has skillfully
grafted one stock upon another. The same thing
can be done with an argument. You have often
observed the way in which a person will start out
to prove one proposition and after a little while
end up with the triumphant demonstration of
something that is quite different. He shows such
an ability at ratiocination that you cannot help
admiring his reasoning powers, though it is hard
to follow him. Your bewilderment comes from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the fact that you had expected the original seedling
to bring forth after its kind, and had not
noticed the point where the scion of a new proposition
had been grafted on.</p>

<p>“Many persons are not troubled at all when the
conclusions are irrelevant. They rather like them
that way. If an argument will not prove one
thing, then let it prove another. It is all in the
day’s work. To persons with this tolerant taste
the variety afforded by the use of the <i>ignoratio
elenchi</i> is very pleasing.”</p>

<p>A chapter is given to the Cross-fertilization of
Fallacies. The author shows how two half-truths
brought together from two widely separated fields
of thought will produce a new and magnificently
variegated form of opinion. The hybrid will surpass
specimens of either of the parent stocks both
in size and showiness. Thus a half-truth of popular
religion cross-fertilized by a half-truth of popular
science will produce a hybrid which astonishes
both the religious and the scientific world. If
we were following the analogy of mathematics
we might assume that two half-truths would
make a whole truth. But when we are dealing
with the marvelous reproductive powers of nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
we find that they make much more than
that.</p>

<p>Scholasticus gives a page or two to the Dwarfing
of Arguments. “The complaint is sometimes
heard that an argument which is otherwise satisfactory
proves too much. This may seem a good
fault to those whose chief difficulty is in making
their arguments prove anything at all. But I assure
you that it is really very troublesome to find
that you have proved more than you intended.
You may have no facilities for dealing with the
surplus conclusions, and you may find all your
plans disarranged. For this reason many persons,
instead of cultivating arguments of the standard
sizes which take a good deal of room, prefer the
dwarf varieties. These are very convenient where
one does not wish one principle to crowd out another
that may be opposed to it. Persons inclined
to moderation prefer to cultivate a number of good
ideas without crowding. The dwarf varieties are
pleasing to the cultivated taste, as they are generally
exceedingly symmetrical, while full-grown
ideas, especially in exposed places, are apt to impress
one as being scraggly.</p>

<p>“Dean Swift, who had no taste for miniature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
excellencies, spoke scornfully of those who plant
oaks in flower-pots. I have, however, frequently
seen very pleasing oaks grown in this way, and
they were not in very big flower-pots, either.</p>

<p>“In moral reasoning, it is especially difficult to
keep our conclusions moderate enough for our
convenience. An ordinary argument always tends
to prove too much. This is disconcerting to those
who are endeavoring to live up to their favorite
text, ‘Be not overmuch righteous.’ The danger
of overmuchness is obviated by cultivating the
fashionable dwarf varieties of righteousness.</p>

<p>“Various methods of dwarfing are practiced
with success. Training will do much; you have
seen trees dwarfed by tying them to a trellis or
against a wall or to stakes, and preventing their
growth beyond the prescribed limits. Incessant
pruning is necessary, and each new growth must
be vigorously headed back. By using the same
means we may cultivate a number of fine ideas,
and at the same time keep them fairly small.”</p>

<p>The least satisfactory chapter is that on Pests.
“It is easy enough,” says Scholasticus, “to describe
a pest, but it is another matter to get rid of
it. The most painstaking fallacy culturist must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
expect to awake some morning and behold his
choicest arguments laid low by some new kind
of critic. There seems to be no limit to the pestiferous
activity of these creatures. They are of
two kinds: those that bite, cutting off the roots
of the argument, and those that suck out the
juices. These latter destroy the vital tissue of
inference on which everything depends. I never
met any one who cultivated arguments on a large
scale who did not have his tale of woe.</p>

<p>“I had at one time a theological friend who
had great reputation as a dogmatist. He had for
many years a garden of fallacies which was one of
the show places. It was in a sheltered situation,
so that many fine old dogmas flourished which
we do not often, in these days, see growing out
of doors. Everything went well until the locality
became infested with destructive criticism. He
tried all the usual remedies without success. At
last he became utterly discouraged, and cut out
all the dead wood, and uprooted all the dogmas
that were attacked by the pest. Since then he
has given up his more ambitious plans, and he
has only a simple little place where he cultivates
those fruits of the spirit which are not affected by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
destructive criticism. It is only fair to say that
he is making a very pleasant place of it.</p>

<p>“For the encouragement of those who are not
ready to take such heroic methods, it may be said
that eternal vigilance, though not a panacea, will do
much. Some of the most dreaded species of critics
are not so dangerous as they seem. Many persons
fear the <i>Criticus Academicus</i>. I have, however, seen
fallacies which survived the attacks of this species
and fell easy victims to the more troublesome
<i>Criticus Vulgaris</i>, or Common Gumption.</p>

<p>“The worst pest is what is known as the <i>Reductio
ad Absurdum</i>. This is a kind of scale which
grows upon a promising argument and eats out
its life. It is so innocent in its appearance that
at first one does not suspect its deadly character.
In fact, it is sometimes taken as an agreeable
ornament. After a little while the argument is
covered over with a sort of dry humor. There
is then no remedy.”</p>

<p>In the chapter on the use of artificial fertilizers,
Scholasticus deals particularly with statistics. He
refers incidentally to their use in the cultivation
of valid arguments. Their importance here
is universally acknowledged. “It should be remembered,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
he says, “that in this case success
depends upon the extreme care with which they
are used. An unusual amount of discrimination
is demanded in their application. For this reason,
if solid conclusions, that head well, are expected,
only experts of good character can be trusted to
do the work.</p>

<p>“There is no such difficulty in the use of statistics,
if the grower is content with arguments of the
fallacious order. Statistics are recommended for a
mulch. By covering a bed of fallacies with a heavy
mulch of miscellaneous statistical matter it is protected
from the early frosts and the later drought.
The ground of the argument is kept thus in a good
condition. No particular care is here needed in
the application of statistics; any man who can
handle a pitchfork can do all that is required. I
have seen astonishing results obtained in this way.
No one need be deterred by the consideration of
expense. In these days statistics are so cheap that
they are within the reach of all. If you do not
care to use the material freely distributed by the
government, you can easily collect a sufficient
amount for yourself.</p>

<p>“The best way is to prepare circulars containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
half a dozen irrelevant questions, which you send
to several thousand persons,—the more the better.
If you enclose stamps, those who are good-natured
and conscientious will send you such odd
bits of opinion as they have no other use for, and
are willing to contribute to the cause of science.
When the contributions are received, assort them,
putting those that strike you as more or less alike
in long, straight rows. Another way, which is
more fancy, is that of arranging them in curves.
This is called ‘tabulating the results.’ When the
results have been thoroughly tabulated, use in
the manner I have described for the protection
of your favorite arguments.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>In this way the book ran on for some three
hundred pages. After I had read it, I congratulated
Scholasticus on his effort. “You have almost
succeeded,” I said, “in making Logic interesting;
that is, if it is Logic. Now that you have
made such a good beginning, I wish you might
go further. You have taught us, by a natural
method, how to reason fallaciously. I wish you
would now teach us how to reason correctly.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could,” said Scholasticus.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5">THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE PEACEMAKERS</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>O one who aspires to “sit and shake in Rabelais’
easy-chair,” the greeting “Peace on
Earth” is a godsend. Was ever such a provocative
to satire? Did ever human nature appear in
a disguise more ridiculously transparent than when
assuming the part of Peacemaker in the midwinter
pantomimes, and impudently laying claim to
the very choicest beatitude? The bold masquerader
has not even the grace to hide his big stick,
but waves it as a wand. We are asked to believe
that the vigorous flourishes of this same big stick
prepare for the age of peace “by prophets long
foretold.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been to a Peace Convention?”
asks the amateur cynic. “It is good fun
if you are fortunate enough to be able to watch
the proceedings from the seat of the scornful.
First come the advocates of Peace pure and simple,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
enthusiasts for non-resistance. As you listen
to the reports of the delegates you feel that the
time has already come when ‘the lion shall eat
straw like the ox.’ Your sympathies go out to
the poor beast in his sudden change of diet,—for
we of the Carnivora have no great appetite
for straw. After a time the lions are led out to
speak for themselves. Representatives of the different
nations give greetings. It appears from
their remarks that the cause is one that has always
been nearest to their valiant hearts. No
need to take measures to convert them,—they
have always been on the right side. What were
teeth and claws invented for, if not to enforce
peace on earth?</p>

<p>“Each nation points with pride to its achievements.
Has not Great Britain made peace in
South Africa, and the United States of America
established it in the Philippines; and was not
Russia a while ago endeavoring to establish it in
Manchuria? Even the little powers are at work
for the same end. Is not disinterested Belgium
making peace on the banks of the Congo, with
rubber and ivory as a by-product? Has not
Holland for these many years been industriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
weeding out the malcontents in Java? The
Christian message of good will has now reached
the most remote recesses of the earth. Even the
monks in Thibet have heard the good news.
They must pay a good round sum for it, to be
sure; but what else could they expect when the
message must be carried to them away up on
the roof of the world, quite beyond the limits of
the free delivery? It’s their own fault that they
never got into full connection with Christendom
before. These unsocial creatures have for generations
been enjoying a selfish peacefulness of their
own. They have been like a householder who
has a telephone, but will not allow his number
to go on the book. He likes to bother other people,
but will not allow them to bother him. It
has long been known that the Mahatmas in Llassa
were in the habit of projecting thought vibrations
to the ends of the earth, and muddling the brains
of the initiated; but the general public could not
reciprocate. The British expedition has changed
all that. Now when Christendom rings them up
they’ve got to answer.”</p>

<p>That word “Christendom” has a singular effect
upon the cynic. It draws out all his acrid humor;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
for it seems to him the quintessence of hypocrisy.</p>

<p>“Christian nations! Christian civilization! A
fine partnership this, between the brutal and the
spiritual! In the pre-Christian era war was a very
simple thing. Read the record of an Israelitish
expedition in the Book of Chronicles. ‘And they
went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the
east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their
flocks. And they found fat pasture and good,
and the land was wide and quiet and peaceable;
for they of Ham had dwelt there of old. And
these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah,
king of Judah, and smote their tents and
the habitations that were found there, and destroyed
them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in
their rooms; because there was pasture there for
their flocks.’</p>

<p>“What an unsophisticated account of an ordinary
transaction! Even the sons of Ham could
understand the motive. There was no profession
of benevolent intent, not even an eloquent reference
to manifest destiny; the fat pastures were
a sufficient reason. In these days the unwilling
beneficiaries of civilization have a harder time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
of it. No sooner are they dispossessed of their
lands than they are called together to rejoice over
the good work that has been done for them.
This is <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> and not <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> The new era began
with an angel chorus; let us all join in the refrain.
First of all, decorum requires that the bare
facts be decently arrayed in spiritual garments.
With the skill that is the result of long practice
the ugliest fact is fitted. It is a triumph of dressmaking.
The materials may be a trifle threadbare,
but with a little fullness here and a breadth
taken out there, each garment is made as good as
new. Not a blood-stain shows.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>This is a free country, and the cynic must be
allowed his fling. But if he has license to speak
his mind in regard to the simple-hearted people
who believe in Peace, we must be privileged to
say what we think of him. The truth is that we
think him to be a rather shallow-pated fellow
who has been educated above his deserts. For
all his knowing ways he has had but little knowledge
of the world. He has seen the things which
are obvious, the things that are shown to every
outsider. He prides himself on his familiarity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
with accomplished facts, not realizing that these
belong to the world that is passing away. The
interesting things to see are those which belong
to the world that is in process of becoming.
These are not visible from the seat of the scornful.</p>

<p>The sweeping accusation of hypocrisy against
men or nations whenever an incongruity is perceived
between a professed purpose and an actual
achievement is an indication of too great simplicity
of mind. It is the simplicity that is characteristic
of one without experience in the work
of creation.</p>

<p>The cynic, perceiving the shortcomings of
those who “profess and call themselves Christians,”
greets their professions with a bitter laugh.
He cannot tolerate their pretensions, and he urges
them to return to a frank profession of the paganism
which their deeds proclaim. Now it is eminently
desirable that all who profess and call
themselves Christians should <i>be</i> Christians,—but
that takes time. The profession is the first step;
that puts a whip into the hand of conscience.
Not only do a man’s friends, but particularly his
enemies, insist that he shall live up to his name.
It is a wholesome discipline. In a new country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
two or three houses set down in a howling wilderness
are denominated a city. It is a mere name
at first, but if all goes well other metropolitan
features are added in due time. I remember a
most interesting visit which I once made to a university
in a new commonwealth. The university
consisted of a board of regents, an unfenced bit
of prairie for a “campus,” a president (who was
also professor of the Arts and Sciences), a janitor,
and two unfinished buildings. A number of the
village children took courses which, if persisted
in for a number of years, might lead to what is
usually termed the Higher Education. One student
from out of town dwelt in solitary state in
the dormitory. The president met me with great
cordiality, and after showing me “the plant” introduced
me to the student. It was evident that
they were on terms of great intimacy, and that
discipline in the university was an easy matter,
owing to the fact that the student body was
homogeneous.</p>

<p>Now it would be easy for one under such circumstances
to laugh at what seemed mere pretentiousness.
“It was nothing more than a small
school; why not call it that and be done with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
it?” The reason for not doing so was that it
aimed at being a university. Its name was a
declaration of purpose. “Despise not the day of
small things.” The small things may be very
real things; and then they have a trick of growing
big before you know it.</p>

<p>In the world of creative activity the thought
precedes the deed, the profession comes before
the achievement. The child makes believe that
he is a man, and his play is prophetic. Let us
grant that multitudes who profess and call themselves
Christians are only playing at Christianity;
they have not yet begun to take the beatitudes
seriously. It is a good thing to play at, and the
play is all the time deepening into earnest work.</p>

<p>When it becomes earnest, it is still far from
perfect; but imperfection of workmanship is no
evidence of insincerity. He would be a poor
critic who at the spring exhibition should accuse
the artist of attempt to deceive because of his
failure to achieve his professed purpose.</p>

<p>“Do you call that a picture of the Madonna?
False-hearted hypocrite! Are you wicked enough
to attempt to poison our minds and prejudice us
against one who has been an object of worship?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
You are foisting upon us an image of absolute
imbecility.”</p>

<p>And yet the poor artist is no hypocrite,—he
is only a poor artist, that is all. He has striven
to express what he has actually felt, and he has
had bad luck. He has been thrilled by an image
of perfect womanhood, and he sought to reproduce
it for the joy of others. He wrought with
sad sincerity, and this is what came of it!</p>

<p>In the work of creating a condition of peace
and good will among men the Christian nations
have not gone very far. But why twit on facts?
Let us be reasonable. Why should we take it as
a grievance that our birth has not been delayed
till the Millennium, but that we have been placed
among those who are responsible for bringing it
in? There is a satisfaction in being allowed a
part in the preliminary work. And what if many
well-meant endeavors have come to nought? Let
us not spend our time crying over the spilt milk
of human kindness. It is natural that the first
attempts at peacemaking should be awkward.
It takes time to get the knack of it. It is foolish
to reserve all our praise for perfection. That
gives an unpleasant impression, such as that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
which we receive from a person who, when there
is a call for small change, produces a bank bill
of a large denomination, which he knows no one
can break for him.</p>

<p>“Peace on earth” is not a statement of accomplished
fact, but a prophecy. Now it is nothing
against a prophecy that it has not yet been fulfilled.
The farther off it is, the more credit to the
eyes that see and to the stout hearts that patiently
wait and work for it. The practical question is
not “Has it come?” but “Is it on the way?”
We are considering a bit of the unfinished business
of the world.</p>

<p>First we must listen to the report of the progress
already made. It is such a modest report
that we must prepare our minds in order to appreciate
it. The simple-minded cynic must be
instructed in regard to the extreme difficulty and
complexity of the work that has been undertaken.
It is nothing less than the transformation of a
carnivorous, not to say cannibalistic, species into
an orderly society in which each member shall
joyously and effectively work for the welfare of
all. The first thing, of course, is to catch your
cannibals. This of itself is no easy task, and has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
taken many centuries. It has involved a vast
amount of wood-chopping and road-making, and
draining of swamps and exploring of caves and
dens. It is a task that is still far from accomplished.
Savagery is a condition which cannot
be abolished till there is a conquest of the earth
itself. When the cannibals have been caught
and tamed there comes the problem of keeping
them alive. They must eat <i>something</i>—a point
which many of the missionaries of civilization
have not sufficiently considered. Ethical progress
is delayed by all sorts of economic complications.
When the natural man is confronted with the
necessity of getting a living, robbery is the first
method which suggests itself to him. When this
is prohibited he turns upon his moral adviser
with, “What more feasible way do you propose?”
The moral adviser has then to turn
from the plain path of pure ethics, and cudgel
his poor wits trying to “invent a little something
ingenious” to keep his pupil from starving. The
clever railer at human kind who has always had
a bank account to fall back upon has no idea
how much time and thought have been taken up
in such contrivances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Then it should be remembered that the missionaries
of civilization have not themselves been
above reproach. The “multitudes of the heavenly
hosts” might be heard for a moment singing of
good will among men, but they did not remain
to do the work. The men of good will who
were to work out the plan were very human
indeed. Milton, in the Hymn “On the Morning
of Christ’s Nativity,” warns us of the long interval
between the Christmas prophecy and its historical
fulfillment.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">This must not yet be so.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>This veto of “wisest Fate” is not absolute. It
only calls a halt upon our imagination until the
rest of our nature catches up with it. Mankind
is not to have peace till it has suffered for it and
worked for it. The workmen must do their work
over and over again till they have learned the
right way.</p>

<p>That the “Christian nations” are not hypocrites,
but novices who have been making some progress
toward the Christian ideal, becomes evident when
we look back over their history. They are not the
descendants of the simple shepherds of the plains
of Bethlehem. Far from it! When they first began
to “profess and call themselves Christians,”
they were not thinking of the beatitudes. They
had not got that far.</p>

<p>Turn to the Heimskringla and read how King
Olaf converted the pagan bonders.</p>

<p>“So King Olaf went into the God-house and a
certain few of his men with him, and a certain
few of the bonders. But when the king came
whereas the gods were, there sat Thor the most
honored of all the gods, adorned with gold and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
silver. Then King Olaf hove up the gold-wrought
rod that he had in his hand and smote Thor that
he fell down from the stall; and therewith ran forth
all the king’s men and tumbled down all the gods
from their stalls. But whiles the king was in the
God-house was Iron-Skeggi slain without, even at
the very door, and that deed did the king’s men.
So when the king was come back to his folk he
bade the bonders take one of two things, either all
be christened, or else abide the brunt of battle with
him. But after the death of Skeggi there was no
leader among the folk of the bonders to raise up
a banner against King Olaf. So the choice was
taken of them to go to the king and obey his bidding.
Then King Olaf christened all folk that
were there and took hostages of the bonders that
they would hold to their christening. Thereafter
King Olaf caused men of his wend over all parts
of Thrandheim; and now spoke no man against
the faith of Christ. And so were all folk christened
in the country-side.”</p>

<p>That is the way the nations of the north were
first christianized. What is the difference between
Thor and the Christ? the simple-hearted people
would ask. “The difference,” said King Olaf, “is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
very fundamental, and it requires little theological
training to see it. It is this: the Christ is stronger.
If you don’t believe it, I’ll”—but they did believe
it.</p>

<p>It is evident that there were some points in
Christianity that King Olaf did not appreciate.
To cultivate these fruits of the spirit required men
of a different temper. Their work is not all done
yet. It is progressing.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>There is one complication in the work of peacemaking
which has not been sufficiently considered.
It is the recurrence of Youth. I have listened to
the arguments against war at a great Peace Congress.
The reasoning was strong, the statement
of facts conclusive. War was shown to be cruel
and foolish, and incredibly expensive. The audience,
consisting of right-minded and very intelligent
people, was convinced of the justice of the
cause of Peace. Why, then, does not the cause
triumph?</p>

<p>In such cases I am in the habit of looking about
with the intent to fix the responsibility where
it belongs, on those who were not at the meeting.
Mature life was well represented, but there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
suspicious absence of young men in the twenties.
Ah! I said, there is the difficulty. We can’t be
sure of lasting peace until we make it more interesting
to these young absentees. They’ll all be
peace men by and by, but meanwhile there is no
knowing what trouble they may get us into.</p>

<p>John Fiske traced the influence which the prolongation
of infancy has had on the progress of
civilization. I am inclined to think that equally
great results would flow from any discovery by
which the period of middle age could be prolonged
beyond its present term. War would be
abolished without any more ado. A uniformly
middle-aged community would be immune from
any attack of militant fever.</p>

<p>It happens, however, that every once in a while
the hot passions of youth carry all before them.
The account of what happened at the beginning
of the civil wars in Israel is typical. King Rehoboam
called a meeting of the elder statesmen of
his kingdom. They outlined a policy that was
eminently conciliatory. But we are told, “He forsook
the counsel of the old men which they had
given him, and consulted with the young men that
were grown up with him and which stood by him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>That’s the difficulty! The hardest thing about
a good policy is to get it accepted by the people
who have the power. What avails the wisdom of
the old men when all the young men are “spoiling
for a fight?” Something more is needed than
statesman-like plans for strengthening the framework
of civilization. You may have a fireproof
structure, but you are not safe so long as it is
crammed with highly inflammable material.</p>

<p>There is a periodicity in the passion for war. It
marks the coming into power of a new generation.
A quarter of a century from now “the good gray
poet” Rudyard Kipling may be singing sweet
lyrics of peace. All things come in time. The
Kipling we know simply utters the sentiments of
“the young men brought up with him.” What
he has been to his contemporaries Tennyson was
to the generation before. Kipling never wrote a
more scornful arraignment of peace or a more
passionate glorification of war than Tennyson’s
“Maud.”</p>

<p>We are listening to the invective of a youth
whose aspirations have been crushed and ideals
shattered by a civilization that seems to him to be
soulless. He has seen something which to him is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
infinitely more cruel than the battle between contending
hosts</p>

<p>That was an appeal to Young England, the
England that was too young to remember the
Napoleonic wars and was thirsting for an experience
of its own.</p>

<p>We may see in such an outburst of the
militant spirit only the recrudescence of savagery.
It is better to treat it seriously, for it is something
which each generation must reckon with.
Tennyson sums up the matter from the standpoint
of ardent youth:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let it flame or fade, and the war roll down like a wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We have proved we have hearts in a cause, we are noble still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And myself have awaked, as it seems, to the better mind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is better to fight for the good than to rail at the ill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have felt with my native land, I am one with my kind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I embrace the purpose of God, and the doom assign’d.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>It is easy enough to dismiss all this as mere vaporing.
But it is a protest which must be heeded,
for it expresses a real experience. There are things
worse than war. A sordid slothfulness is worse. A
cowardly acquiescence in injustice is worse. It
is a real revelation when to the heart of youth
comes a sudden sense of the meaning of life. It is
not a treasure to be preserved with miserly carefulness.
It is to be nobly hazarded. It <i>is</i> better
to fight for the good than to rail, however eloquently,
against the ill. To feel for one’s native
land, to unite in generous comradeship with one’s
kind, to endure hardness for a noble cause,—these
things are of the essence of manhood.</p>

<p>In times of national peril such awakening has
come. Many a man has then for the first time
discovered that he has a soul. He has cried out,
“Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of
the Lord.”</p>

<p>Now just here we peace men may see our most
inspiring bit of unfinished business. War has been
idealized; it is left to us to idealize peace. It cannot
be done till we bring out all its heroic possibilities.
If it means dull stagnation, selfish ease,
the prosperity that can be measured in dollars and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
cents, there is sure to come a revulsion against it.
The gospel of the full dinner-pail and the plethoric
pocket-book does not satisfy. If the choice is
between commercialism and militarism we need
not wonder if many an idealist chooses the latter
as the less perilous course. It seems less threatening
toward the things for which he cares.</p>

<p>The call is for a new chivalry. Our duty is not
only to keep the peace, but to make a peace that
is worth keeping. This is no easy task. It means
the humanizing of all our activities. Everywhere
a human ideal must be placed above every other
kind of success. Religion must be lifted above
ecclesiasticism; and business honor above the vulgar
standards of commercialism. The machinery
of civilization must be made subservient to man.
More careers must be opened for men of the soldierly
spirit whose ambition is for service. The
new generation must be shown what opportunities
the world’s business and politics offer to great-hearted
gentlemen who are willing to risk something
for a cause. The kind of peace which the
world needs cannot be had for the asking. It comes
high,—but it is worth the price.</p>

<p>Are you not constrayned (my fellow Academicks) to subscribe
to this my opinion that the knowledge of no nation is so
necessary as the searching out of a man’s own Country and the
manners thereof and the right understanding of that Commonweale
whereof each one of us is a part and member. The Lamiæ
that are a certaine kind of monsters are laughed at in the Poeticall
Fables in that they were so blinde at home that they could
not see their own affaires, could foresee nothing; but when they
were once gone from home they were accounted the most sharpe-sighted
and curious searchers of all others.... [Are not they]
very ridiculous when as by taking long voyages unto farre remote
people, after they have curiously sought out all matters amongst
them are ignorant of the principall things at home and know not
what is contayned within the precincts of their country, and are
reckoned altogether strangers on their native soile?—<span class="smcap">Coryat’s</span>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE remark that Boston is not so much a
place as a state of mind is one of the highest
compliments ever paid to that city. Places are
common enough, the maps are dotted with them,
but a state of mind is a mark of distinction. The
Bostonian enjoys his state of mind none the less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
because he is aware that outsiders are not always
able to enter into it.</p>

<p>Only those places which have become symbolic
of mental or moral traits are remembered. Sodom
and Gomorrah were once towns of some commercial
importance. We think of them, however, not
as trade centres, but as sins. Babylon, according to
a doctrine of spiritual correspondences long since
established, is another name for proud and cruel
worldliness. It is likely so to remain, in spite of
the discovery of clay tablets which show that
many of its people were estimable citizens who
practiced domestic economy and collected their
debts by due process of law. All we have to say
is that those who acted in this commonplace way
were not typical,—in fact, they were quite un-Babylonian.
In like manner, Zion represents no
longer a hill whose altitude may be prosaically
estimated according to the metric system. It is a
highly exalted frame of pious joy.</p>

<p>It is strange that, with all the ingenuity that has
been shown in inventing new text-books for the
use of schools, no one has compiled a Psychological
Geography. The materials are ample. It only
needs some one with a scientific imagination, or,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
rather, with a capacity for writing imaginative
science, to make it a success. Eliminating those
communities whose states of mind are so mixed
as to be unclassifiable, the way would be clear
for a very pretty series of generalizations. There
would be maps with isothermal lines uniting places
of equal degrees of warmth of temperament or
frigidity of manner. Weather charts would show
the direction of the various winds of doctrine and
the storm centres, religious and political. The theory
of moral cyclones and anti-cyclones would be
adequately explained. There would be maps in
colors indicating the communities situated on the
plateaus of conscious ethical and intellectual superiority.
These often rise into the arid, or at least
semi-arid, belt. In sharp contrast with these are
the luxuriant bottom lands, where less favored
peoples dwell in happy ignorance of their low
estate. The “principal products” would be graphically
illustrated. One section, being without natural
resources, is given over to the manufacture
of novelties, while another is rich in fossils. The
distribution of fads may be shown to advantage.
Some localities are almost barren, while others are
naturally faddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>When he comes to the Points of the Compass
the most matter-of-fact psychological geographer
will forget the cold mannerisms of his science and
become poetical. North, South, East, West, these
are vast symbols of psychic forces. He would not
think of putting at the head of the chapter the picture,
from the old Geography, of the disconsolate
urchin with his face to the north and his arms
extended in rigid but reluctant testimony to the
fact that “East is East and West is West.” What
does this featureless boy know of those tremendous
forces whose age-long contests have made the history
of the world? What does he know of the
hardiness and the prowess that make the true
North? If he were forcibly turned around, his
face would be as expressionless as ever. Such a
mannikin never felt a sudden longing for “a
beaker full of the warm South.”</p>

<p>Art must be called to the aid of science. Each
point of the compass has an expression of its own.
One should be able by looking at the face of the
man in the picture to know the direction. There
is no mistaking the qualities which grow only
where there is a northerly exposure. The Orient
and the Occident are not to be confounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Were some affluent citizen to endow a chair of
psycho-geographical science in one of our leading
universities, especial attention should be paid to
the teaching of Systematic Americanism. It is a
branch now much neglected. The professor should
take pains to instruct his “fellow Academicks” in
the manners and customs of their own country, so
that they should no longer be reckoned strangers
on their native soil. They should be taught to
avoid entangling analogies drawn from the experience
of other lands, and to look directly at the
subject-matter. When they see something going
wrong, they should not jump at the conclusion
that it is a repetition of the classic tragedy of the
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,—for it
may be something quite different. When there
is a popular movement on the prairies, they should
not begin to talk of the French Revolution and of
the excesses of the proletariat. Before they talk in
European fashion of the “classes and the masses,”
they should make certain that we have such
things, and if we have, that there is a sure way of
telling which is which. The Old-World generalizations
about the upper and lower and middle
classes should be well shaken before using.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Those who elect the course in Americanism
should be taught to overcome the nervous fright
to which bookish people are subject at the appearance
of any man in public life who shows signs
of unusual virility. It is a weakness of those who
are more familiar with the careers of Cæsar and
Napoleon than with the temper of their fellow-citizens.
In the early seventies there were academic
minds thoroughly convinced that they were
watching the Republic in its death struggle with
Cæsarism. Curiously enough, they fixed upon
plain Ulysses Grant to act the part of Cæsar. It
would have been hard to find one less fitted for
the rôle. When we look back and contrast what
really happened with what the well-read spectators
thought was happening, we are reminded of
the remark of the British matron to her husband
as they left the theatre where they had been seeing
the play of “Antony and Cleopatra,” “How
unlike the home life of our dear Queen!”</p>

<p>The great thing, as President Roosevelt has
often reminded us, is to “think nationally.” This
is no small achievement. A nation is a psycho-geographical
fact which it requires a very great
effort of the imagination to conceive. The same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
word represents a land and the people who inhabit
it. The physical features of the landscape
have their spiritual counterparts. It may be that
the landscape impresses itself on the imagination
of the race, or, as may be maintained with equal
plausibility, the imagination of a gifted race may
interpret the landscape and impress itself upon it
forever. In either case there is a recognizable harmony
between the two elements. In reading the
great literature of Israel we never forget that the
nation was desert-born. “He found him in a
desert place, he led him about, he instructed him.”
In psalm and prophecy we are conscious of barren
mountain ranges, of rocks in a weary land, of
narrow valleys which laugh for very joy over the
incongruity between themselves and the surrounding
desolations. There is the passion of the desert,
born of solitude and the stars. In the prophet of
righteousness there is the same urgent note that
Bayard Taylor catches in his “Bedouin Song:”—</p>

<p>England and her Englishmen are forever inseparable.
“This happy breed of men” belong to
“this little world, this precious stone set in a silver
sea, this blessed plot, this England.” That Great
Britain is an island is more than a fact of physical
geography. It is the outward and visible sign of
an insularity of sentiment which gives its peculiar
quality to British patriotism. There is something
snug and homelike about it, as of a family
that enjoys “the tumultuous privacy of storm.”</p>

<p>We become conscious of Spain and her Spaniards

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>When we come to the United States of America
there is a peculiar difficulty in thinking and
feeling nationally, because the imagination does
not at once find the physical facts to serve as symbols.
It is not easy to conceive the land as a whole.
When we sing “My Country, ’tis of thee,” the
country that is visualized is very small. The author
of the hymn was a New England clergyman,
and naturally enough described New England and
called it America. It is a land of rocks and rills
and woods, and the hills are templed, in Puritan
fashion, by white meeting-houses; for the early
New Englander, like erring Israel of old, loved to
worship on “the high places.” Over it all is one
great tradition: it is the “land of the Pilgrims’
pride.”</p>

<p>The farmer in North Dakota loves his country,
too; but the idea that it is a land of rocks and
rills and templed hills seems to him rather farfetched.
His heart does not thrill with rapture
when he thinks of these things. He can plow all
day in the Red River valley without striking a
stone, and he is glad to have it so.</p>

<p>The Texan cultivates an exuberant Americanism,
but he does not think of his country as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
“land of the Pilgrims’ pride.” Texas is not proud
of the Pilgrims, and perhaps the Pilgrims would
not have appreciated Texas.</p>

<p>When the American has come to feel, not provincially,
but nationally, the words “my country”
bring to his mind not merely some familiar scenes
of his childhood, but a series of vast pictures.
They are broad and simple in outline. “My
country” is no tight little island shut out from
“the envy of less happier lands.” It is continental
in its sweep. It lies open and free to all. It is
large and easy of access. There is a vision of
busy cities serving as its gateways. Behind them
is a pleasant home-like land with “a sweet interchange
of hill and valley.” Beyond the mountains
another scene opens. We see the sources of
the strength of America and feel the promise of
its future. To see the Mississippi valley is to believe
in “manifest destiny,” and to take a cheerful
view of it. To the ancient world the valley of the
Nile was the symbol of fertility. It is a narrow
ribbon of green in the midst of the desert. Here
Plenty and Famine were in plain sight of one
another. There was always the suggestion of
Pharaoh’s ugly dream of the lean kine devouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
the fat and well-favored. But in the valley of the
Mississippi the fear of the lean kine is dispelled.
One may travel at railroad speed day after day,
and still the fields of wheat and corn smile upon
him. Here the ample land gives happy confidence
to men’s prayer for daily bread. And beyond the
fertile prairies “my country” stretches in high
plains and lofty mountain ranges. Here are new
treasures waiting bold spirits who claim them.
The land has a challenge and an invitation.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">What a weary dearth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the homes of men! What a wild delight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of space, of room! What a sense of seas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where seas are not! What salt-like breeze!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What dust and taste of quick alkali!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>And beyond the mountains lies the American
Avilion, where never—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent5">wind blows loudly; but it lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deep-meadow’d, happy, fair with orchard lawns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bowery hollows: crown’d with summer seas.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>And this great land is one; though it is “a nation
of nations” it has achieved a national consciousness.
There is an atmosphere about it all which
we recognize. To breathe it is an exhilaration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
One loves to think of it as the land of “the large
and charitable air.”</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The conception of the continental proportions
of America did not at once dawn upon its new
inhabitants. They thought and spoke as transplanted
Englishmen. Each of the thirteen States
was a tight little republic insisting on its own
rights. Each plucky Diogenes sat in its own tub,
saying to its neighbors, “Get out of my sunshine!”</p>

<p>It was only as they turned westward that
Americans discovered America,—a discovery
which in some instances has been long delayed.
“The West” is not merely a geographical expression,
it is a state of mind which is most distinctive
of the national consciousness. It is a
feeling, an irresistible impulse. It is the sense of
undeveloped resources and limitless opportunities.
It is associated with the verb “to go.” To
the American the West is the natural place to go
to, as the East is the place to come from. It is
synonymous with freedom from restraint. It is
always “out West.”</p>

<p>Just where the geographical West begins it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
not necessary to indicate. On the coast of Maine
you may be shown a summer cottage and told
that it belongs to a rich Westerner from Massachusetts.
Massachusetts is not thought of as
exactly the Far West, but it is far enough.</p>

<p>The psychological West begins at the point
where the centre of interest suddenly shifts from
the day before yesterday to the day after to-morrow.
Great expectations are treated with the respect
that elsewhere had been reserved for accomplished
facts. There is a stir in the air as if Humanity
were a new family just setting up housekeeping.
What a fine house it is, and how much room there
is on the ground floor! What a great show it will
make when all the furniture is in! There is no
time now for the finishing touches, but all will
come in due order. There is need for unskilled
labor and plenty of it. Let every able-bodied man
lend a hand.</p>

<p>One does not know his America until he has
been touched by the Western fever. He must be
possessed by a desire to take up a claim and build
himself a shack and invest in a corner lot in a
Future Great City. He must be capable of a
disinterested joy in watching the improvements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
which other people are making. Let the man of
the East cling to the old ways and seek out the
old landmarks. The symbol of the West is the
plank sidewalk leading out from a brand-new
prairie town and pointing to a thriving suburb
which as yet exists only in the mind of its projector.
There is something prophetic in that sidewalk
on which the foot of man has never trod.</p>

<p>One who has once had this fever never completely
recovers. Though he may change his environment
he is always subject to intermittent
attacks.</p>

<p>I remember on my first evening in Oxford
sitting blissfully on the top of a leisurely tram car
that trundled along High Street. The dons in
academic garb were on their way to dinner in the
college halls, and they looked just as my imagination
had pictured them. I was introduced to one
of them. When he learned that I was an American,
there was a sudden thaw in his manner.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been in Dodge City, Kansas?”
he inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>I modestly replied that I had only passed
through on the railway, but I was familiar with
other Kansas towns, and, reasoning from analogy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
I could tell what manner of place it was. This was
enough. I had experienced the West. I was one
of the initiated. I could enter into that state of
mind represented by the term Dodge City. It appeared
that in the golden age, when he and Dodge
City were both young, he had sought his fortune
for some months in Kansas. He had experienced
the joys of civic newness, a newness such as had
not been in England since the Heptarchy. He
discoursed of the mighty men of those days when
every man did what was right in his own eyes,
and good-humoredly allowed his neighbor to do
likewise. As we parted, he said, with mournful
acquiescence in his present estate, “Oxford does
very well, you know, but it isn’t Dodge City.”
If poetry is emotion remembered in tranquillity,
what could be more poetical than Dodge City remembered
in the tranquillity of Oxford quadrangles?</p>

<p>In this case the poetical view was a sound one.
The traveler across the newly developed States of
the West has the traveler’s license to contrast unfavorably
that which he sees with that which he
left behind him in his home country. He may say
a dozen uncomplimentary things, and each one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of them may be true. He may exhaust all his
stock adjectives, as “crude” and “raw” and the
like. But when he remarks, as did a certain critic,
that because the country lacks “distinction” it is
uninteresting, he betrays his own limitations.</p>

<p>It is just that lack of distinction that makes
America interesting. Here, no longer distracted
by what is exceptional, one may take the welfare
of the masses of men seriously.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here the doings of men correspond to the broad doings of the day and the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>When Shelley was an undergraduate he was
attracted to a lecture on mineralogy. It seemed to
him a subject full of poetical suggestiveness. His
expectations were disappointed, and he unceremoniously
bolted and returned to his room. “What
do you think the man talked about? Stones!—stones!—stones!
I tell you stones are not interesting—in
themselves.”</p>

<p>Shelley was right. Stones are not interesting in
themselves; neither are railroads, nor stockyards,
nor new unpainted buildings, nor endless cornfields.
But for that matter, neither are crumbling
columns, nor old manuscripts, nor the remains of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
feudal castles interesting—in themselves. Things
become interesting only when seen in relation to
the people whose thoughts they have stimulated
and whose imaginations they have stirred.</p>

<p>America is a fresh field for human endeavor.
Here are men busily making roads, bridging rivers,
building new cities. They have been given
the task of subduing a continent. But in such conflicts
with Nature the conquered influences the
conquerors. What impress does the continent
make upon the minds of the hardy men who are
mastering it? What visions of the future do they
see which transform their drudgery into an heroic
adventure?</p>

<p>In the case of the older nations such questions
about the beginnings and the ideals of the beginners
cannot be answered. The formative period,
with all its significant aspirations, is buried in oblivion.
“Who thinks any more as they thought?”
we ask in regard to the pioneer of Britain. Poetry
has license to picture him as a knight in armor
and to tell how in romantic fashion he pitched</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His tents beside the forest. And he drave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heathen, and he slew the beast, and felled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The forest, and let in the sun.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>
<p>It was all a long time ago, and the men who did
these things are not clearly revealed. Not being
able to get at their ideals, we attribute to them
those which we think appropriate.</p>

<p>The historians are troubled by their lack of
authentic material. They are like the magicians,
astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans of the court
of Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar had a
dream that he knew was very important, but
before he could get it interpreted by his wise men
he forgot what it was. They were good at interpretations,
and could have made one to fit if only
the king had brought the dream with him so that
they could try it on. But that was the very thing
he could not do.</p>

<p>The founders of London and Paris had doubtless
their dreams of the future; but alas! they have
long since been forgotten. But Chicago has not
had time to forget. Everything is still vivid. Men
walk the streets of the great city who remember
it when it was no bigger than the Londinium of
the time of the Cæsars. They have with their own
eyes watched every step in the civic development
and they have been a part of all that they have
seen. The Londoner has seen only a passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
phase of his London; the greater part of its history
is received on hearsay evidence. The Chicagoan
sees his Chicago steadily and sees it whole. No
wonder that there is a self-consciousness about the
new metropolis that is not to be found in the old.
Its greatness has been thrust upon it suddenly,
and there is a full realization of its value.</p>

<p>The genuine American who is the maker of the
new fortunes of the world, and who is in love with
his work, has not been adequately portrayed in
literature. It requires an ample imagination to do
justice to his character. There must be a mingling
of realism and romance. The realism must
not be the minute, painstaking portraiture of a
Miss Austen, but the hearty, out-of-door reality of
a Fielding. The American Fielding has not yet
appeared, but what a good time he will have when
he comes! What a host of characters after his own
heart he will find! The American Scott, too, is
called for to give us a story of American life
which will read as well on the edge of a clearing
in the forest as “The Lady of the Lake” did in
the trenches of Torres Vedras, when the soldiers
forgot the enemy’s shells as they gave a glorious
shout over the poet’s lines, which their captain was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
reading to them. I like that story, in spite of the
fact that a recent critic declares that to like it
shows an uncultivated taste. “This is not,” he says,
“a test of poetry. An audience less likely to be
critical, a situation less likely to induce criticism,
can hardly be imagined.” Nevertheless, Scott
would much rather have written lines that rang
true to soldiers in the hour of battle, than to have
been given a high mark by the most competent
corrector of daily themes.</p>

<p>The imagination of Hawthorne, brooding over
the past, repeopled the House of the Seven
Gables with the successive generations. But there
is another kind of romance, in which the imagination
is projected into the future. Looking at the
new house not yet enclosed against the storm, it
dreams dreams and sees visions. There is a story
there, also, and the best of it is that it is to be
continued.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>A shrewd old New England farmer recounted
to me the warlike exploits of his family. He himself
had been in Gettysburg, and each generation
since the time of the French and Indian wars had
had its soldier. His son had been shot at Santiago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
“The bullet went clean through his body,” he
said, indicating a course which seemed to me necessarily
fatal. I expressed sympathy. “Oh, it didn’t
hurt him much,” he said, “it seemed to go through
a vacant spot.”</p>

<p>That there are vacant spots in the character
of the typical man of the Western world no one
would be more ready to admit than he. His shortcomings
are obvious. Yet most of those which
have been harshly commented upon by the world
are of the kind that might be commended to the
consideration of the kindly Pardoner. Some of his
weaknesses touch upon nobleness. Those who
best know his environment and the work he has
done are most ready to grant him a reasonable
degree of indulgence.</p>

<p>The most serious charges against him are that
he is a boastful materialist enamored of crude bulk,
and that he has trampled upon the old sanctities
and is a worshiper of the almighty dollar. There
is some color for these charges in his manners, but
those who make them have certainly not understood
his spirit. “The Western Goth,” Lowell
called him. The Goths had a bad reputation once
as wanton destroyers of ancient art. But after they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
had had their fling and had settled down, the
Teutonic barbarians showed that they could
make a thing or two themselves. Gothic has
long since ceased to be a term of reproach. Even
in the destruction of the ancient, archæologists
now admit that the Goths did not do as much
harm as was at first feared. The real destroyers
of ancient Rome have been the Romans.</p>

<p>From the fact that western America is a place
where people are actively engaged in making
money, and that they find their work so interesting
that they like to talk about it, the superficial
observer jumps at the conclusion that this is the
seat of the cult of wealth-worship. But there is a
vast difference between making a thing and worshiping
it. It is reported that one of the varied
industries of Great Britain is the manufacture of
molten images. It is undoubtedly a sin, but the
British manufacturer comforts himself with the
reflection that he only breaks half the commandment;
he makes the idol, but he does not bow
down before it.</p>

<p>Worship is not talkative or boastful. It is reserved
and self-abasing. The worshiper accepts
the superiority of the object of his devotion as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
a fact not to be questioned. For such serious-minded
worship of wealth go to the English moral
tales so popular a generation or two ago, before
the wave of democracy came in. Then the affluent
Squire and his lady were lifted into the place
of superior beings. They dispensed bounty after
the manner of Providence to their poorer neighbors,
and there was no thought of questioning their
ways. They were rich, as had been their fathers
and mothers before them, and all other virtues
were attributed to them by fond superstition.</p>

<p>The men of the Western mining camps, where
millionaires are made in a day, have no conception
of such a reverential attitude toward the possessor
of wealth. When you see them in the eager
pursuit of dollars, you are watching not their religion,
but their sport. They care for money as
the fox-hunter cares for the fox. They admire the
man who wins the prize, in proportion to the skill
and pluck which he has exhibited. But there are
no illusions of a personal superiority imparted by
the possession of property. That is impossible in
a community where everybody is acquainted with
the short and simple annals of the rich.</p>

<p>The man who is conspicuously successful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the national sport is undoubtedly an object of interest,
but it is interest of the superficial sort. He
is not the man whom the people delight to honor,
and he usually has the good sense to know it. In
a Western newspaper my attention was attracted
by the headlines: “Noah a Millionaire.” It seems
that some one had calculated that, even after
making allowance for the low price of labor and
materials in his day, the Ark must have cost over
half a million dollars, and that Noah must have
had at least a million in order prudently to undertake
the work. It put the patriarch in a fresh
light, and I read the article diligently, as did most
of my fellow passengers on the train. But that was
the end of it; our opinions about diluvian and
antediluvian matters remained unchanged. I suppose
that the publicity given to the doings of our
conspicuously rich contemporaries has no greater
significance.</p>

<p>The millionaire who cares for the admiration of
his fellow-citizens must do more than accumulate.
When he has made his fortune the next question
is, “What will he do with it?” He must do something
or sink into the rank of nobodies. Even the
most selfish and parsimonious feels that something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
is required of him. A great part of the stream of
new wealth may be wasted, so far as the higher
interests of society are concerned, but a certain
part of it is pretty certain to be directed toward
those same higher interests. The process is like
that which goes on with an hydraulic ram. Where
there is a good stream of water, one can afford to
lose most of it. The waste water, before it escapes
down the hill, pumps a slender but sufficient stream
into the second story.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is the interest of our millionaires in
art, science, and religion which has created a puzzling
ethical problem. They are not content to
be mere money-getters. They aspire to be benefactors
on a large scale. But what if the wealth
so freely offered has not been honestly come by?
What if the best institutions should hesitate to receive it?
The poor rich man cannot contemplate
such a refusal with equanimity. It would interfere
with the fulfillment of his most cherished
plans. To have unlimited opportunities to make
money, and to be hindered in giving it away,
seems to him like building a trunk line of railroad
and then being denied terminal facilities. Of
course he could change his plans and keep it all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
himself, but to a man who had been accustomed
to “doing things” that would be a humiliating
anti-climax.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The fact that the American is greatly absorbed
in his work with material things is no sufficient
basis of the charge of materialism that is lightly
brought against him. The crucial question is,
“What do the things stand for in his mind? Are
they finalities, or are they means to an end?” The
most appalling picture of a purely materialistic
civilization is that given in the book of the Revelation.
It is an inventory of the wealth of the
Babylon which was Imperial Rome. The inventory
is an indictment. “The merchandise of gold,
and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and
fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and
all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory,
and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and
of brass, and iron, and marble, and cinnamon, and
odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine,
and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and
sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and
souls of men.”</p>

<p>The heart grows sick when the list of commodities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
ends with the “souls of men.” What were
they worth, measured against all that goes before?</p>

<p>A very different impression comes as we read
Joaquin Miller’s exultant cry over the West:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>This frank delight in the riches of the earth is
not materialistic. The souls of men are not in
the market. They form the supreme standard of
value. Materialism is not a disease to which nations
are subject in their lusty youth. It comes
with senile decay.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we are wearied with the intense
activity of modern life we quote the saying,
“Things are in the saddle.” Perhaps our sympathy
is misplaced. If the poor Things could speak,
they would tell us that, so far from being in the
saddle, they are under the lash of furious young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
idealists who give them no rest. It is the nature of
a Thing to “stay put,” but these headstrong youths
despise this conservative bias. They are no respecters
of Things, being wholly absorbed in Purposes.</p>

<p>To see Things in undisputed possession, go into
“the best room” of a respectable old farmhouse.
Here the Thing has the place of honor, and the
Person is a base intruder, having no rights of his
own. The priestess hovers occasionally around
her sacred Things, waving her feather duster as a
mystic wand, and then leaves them in respectful
gloom. Nothing short of a death in the family
would induce her to disturb them. Go into a busy
workshop, and you may see how the Thing may
be taught to know its place. It is always at the
mercy of the innovating Intelligence. When a
new Idea comes, the old Thing which had heretofore
had a useful function is thrown aside. It is
still as good as it ever was, but it is not good
enough. It must go to the scrap pile.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The man of the West is likely to offend against
the standards of propriety in speech. When he
begins to explain the character of his country, he
is accused of inaccuracy. His prospectus is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
always confirmed by the Table of Contents. He
has acquired the habit of “talking large.” This
prejudices many people against him. They accuse
him of willful exaggeration, and if he be the promoter
of some commercial enterprise, they impute
to him a mercenary motive.</p>

<p>But he is in reality quite sincere. If he talks
large, it is only because he feels large. His is a
language natural to those who are engaged in
creative work, and who foresee great things. It is
like “the large utterance of the early gods.” He
does not feel called upon to limit his statements
to the facts that are already apparent; he expects
the facts to grow up to his statements. He is not
shooting at a fixed target, but at a flying mark; if
he is to hit it, he must aim a little ahead.</p>

<p>Another reason for this large utterance is that
in a new country the ordinary man identifies himself
with his community in a way impossible to
any but very great magnates in an old civilization.
He feels very much as did the kings and earls
he has read about. How proudly on the Shakespearean
stage a great noble will speak of himself
as Norfolk or Northumberland! It is as if his
personality had been multiplied by so many square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
miles. He is no longer a mere individual,—he
is a whole county.</p>

<p>An American may have much the same sense
of territorial aggrandizement by identifying himself
with a promising community in its first stage
of growth. He is not a unit lost in a multitude.
His town has a fine name and a glorious future.
Some day these glories may be divided among
thousands, now they are his own. He is proud of
the town, and the pride is more satisfying because
he is it.</p>

<p>I once camped for a whole month in the city
of Naples on the shores of the Pacific. I knew it
was a city, for a huge sign announced the fact to
every one who passed by the beautiful, secluded
spot. Unlike some of the boom towns of that
period, Naples had an inhabitant, whom I had
occasion frequently to meet. When I addressed
him, it was hard for me to use his surname, as I
would with a common man. For to me he was
Naples. It would have seemed appropriate for
him to speak in blank verse.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>There are those who look upon the Western
delight in the idea of bigness as an evidence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
vulgarity of sentiment and of the lack of idealism.
They have a scorn of those who habitually think
of quantity rather than of quality. But the man
of fastidious taste should not be allowed to have
it all his own way. One poet may be inspired by
“the murmur of a hidden brook in the leafy month
of June.” But another may prefer to stand on the
shore of the ocean and feel its immensity. He is
tremendously impressed by its size. It is a big
thing. But the ocean is as poetical as the brook,
though in its own huge way.</p>

<p>There are some things wherein quality is the
first consideration. They are the luxuries of life.
But when we come to the prime necessities, the
first question is in regard to the adequacy of the
supply. When a sentimental young lady was
seated at dinner next to a great poet, she waited,
awestruck, for him to give utterance to a fine
thought. The only gem he vouchsafed was, “How
do you like your mutton? I like mine in hunks.”
The poet was a man of sound sense. There is one
law for poetry and another for mutton. Poetry is
precious, and a little goes a long way; we can get
on without any but the best. But mutton should
be served more generously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>It is the glory of the West that it treats what
elsewhere are the luxuries of the few as the necessities
of the many. It dispenses even “the
higher education” not in dainty morsels, but in
hunks.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Means, in “The Hoosier Schoolmaster,”
formulated the wisdom of the pioneer.
“You see, this ’ere bottom land was all Congress
land in them there days and sold for a dollar and
a quarter, and I says to my old man, ‘Jack,’ says
I, ‘do you git a plenty while you’re gittin’. Git a
plenty while you’re gittin’,’ says I, ‘for ’twont be
no cheaper than ’tis now;’ and it haint, and I
knowed ’twouldn’t.”</p>

<p>Translate Mrs. Means’s shrewd maxim into the
terms of idealism, and you have the characteristic
contribution of the West. The old prudential
maxims, which were true enough in a finished
civilization, may well be disregarded by those who
face a great new opportunity. They can well afford
to preëmpt more territory than they can at
present cultivate. When one’s aims are selfish, the
desire to get a plenty is mere greed, but in the
altruist it rises into “the enthusiasm for humanity.”
It is the ambition to supply the wants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
men no longer in niggardly fashion, but in full
measure.</p>

<p>In two directions the expectation of moral
amplitude in things American is fulfilled,—in
Education and in Charity. Here we feel that the
people have been aroused to the need of making
plentiful provision, not only for immediate necessities,
but for future growth. Along these lines
we think and plan nationally.</p>

<p>But there are some questions which give pause
to the most boastful patriot. Where is the distinctive
American Art which interprets in a broad,
fresh way the genius of the land, and where is
the public that would recognize it and delight
in it if it should appear? Where is the great
American Church able splendidly to organize the
forces of spiritual freedom as Rome organized
the principles of ecclesiastical authority? How is
the vision of her prophets fulfilled?</p>

<p>Where are these “deific faiths and amplitudes”
that are worthy of the land embodied?</p>

<p>America presents new problems for statesmanship;
where are the large-hearted, clear-eyed men
who give themselves to the task? Here and there
we see them. In the crisis of the nation’s life nature
came to the rescue.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p>That is the kind of manhood America needs. Is
the supply equal to the demand? The growth of
wealth in the Republic has been marvelous. Has
there been evolved a wisdom equal to the task of
justly distributing what enterprise has created?
We hear of American “Captains of Industry.”
How far have they realized Carlyle’s idea when
he gave the title to those whose success lies not
in personal gain but in ability to be real leaders
of men? How far has America produced great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
captains, able to bring into commerce and manufacture
the soldierly virtues of courage, loyalty,
and willing obedience?</p>

<p>When he considers these things the just critic
must say to the Republic, “Thou art weighed in
the balances and found wanting.” But let him
not hastily assume that he is reading the mystic
handwriting on the wall, the <i>Mene, mene, tekel,
upharsin</i>, that foretells the fall of nations. Let
him rather talk as to a young athlete who has not
come up to the mark, “You have done much, but
you have not yet done your best! You are yet
wanting in some essential elements. You must
try again.”</p>

<p>The American idealist recognizes the present
failures, but it does not quench his high spirits.
They come to him as challenges. He takes his
falls as Adam and Eve took theirs. After the first
shock was over there was a healthy reaction.</p>

<p>The most hopeful sign of the times is the number

They attack the abuses of democracy with a
cheery iconoclasm. They are impelled to their

that we watch these pioneers. Their world is all

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">A COMMUNITY OF HUMORISTS</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>UMOR is not usually looked upon as a
civic virtue. It is for the most part confined
to a modest sphere of usefulness, and is accepted as
an alleviation to the lot of the private man. He
learns to find pleasure in his small misadventures
and to smile amiably at his discomfitures. The
most ancient pleasantries have almost always an
element of domesticity. They form the silver
lining to the clouds that sometimes gather over
the most peaceful homes. What comfort an
ancient Hebrew must have taken in the text
from Ecclesiasticus: “As climbing up a sandy
way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of
words to a quiet man.” The quiet man would
murmur to himself, “How true!” He would
seize the simile as a dog snatches a bone, and
would carry it off to enjoy it by himself.</p>

<p>But it would never occur to him to treat the
large affairs of the community in this fashion.
Here everything seems too dignified to allow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
pleasant conceits. The quiet man could not treat
the prolixity of his social superiors as he could
the too long drawn out wisdom of his wife. He
must take it, as he would take the invariable laws of
nature, with unsmiling acquiescence. Lord Bacon
in his list of works that ought to be undertaken
declared the need of one to be entitled “Sober
Satire; or the Insides of Things.” Such sober
satire might express the moods of a philosophical
statesman, who could contrast the inside of great
affairs with the outside. It implies a certain familiarity
with the institutions of society which the
common man does not possess.</p>

<p>Now and then, however, there is a reversal of
the usual relation. The community is of such a
nature that each member can see through it and all
around it. The ordinary citizen becomes a philosopher
indulging habitually in sober satire. He
knows that things are not as they seem, and is
pleased at the discovery. In such a case humor
envelops everything and becomes the last word
of sociological wisdom.</p>

<p>So it was in a community which I fondly remember.
It was not much to look at, this brand-new
Nevada mining town. The main street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
swaggered up the gulch in a devil-may-care fashion,
as if saying to the teamsters, “You may take
me or leave me.” To the north it pointed to an
alkali flat, and to the south to a dusty old mountain,
which was immensely richer than it seemed.
On the mountain side were hoisting works and
hundreds of prospect holes which menaced the
lives of the unwary. In the gulch were smelters
which belched forth divers kinds of fumes. To
the stranger they seemed to threaten wholesale
asphyxiation, but to the citizen they gave the
place the character of a health resort. An analysis
of the air showed that it contained more chemicals
than were to be found in the most famous
mineral springs. Certain it was that there were
enough to kill off all germs of contagious diseases.
The community felt the need of no further hygienic
precautions, and put its trust in its daily
fumigations. No green thing was in sight, not so
much as a grass blade, for the fumes were not only
germicides, but also herbicides. On the main street
were saloons and gambling houses, in close proximity
to two or three struggling churches. There
were two daily newspapers, each of which kept
us informed of the other’s manifold iniquities. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
narrow-gauge railroad had its terminus at the foot
of the gulch. Once a day a mixed train would
depart for the world that lay beyond the alkali
flat. Some of the passengers would be “going
below,” which meant nothing worse than a trip
to California; others were promoters going East
on missions of mercy to benighted capitalists.
The promoter was our nearest approach to a professional
philanthropist. As for the rest, the chief
impression was of dust. It would roll in great
billows down the gulch; it seemed as if the
mountains had been pulverized. Then the wind
would change and the dust billows would roll
back. No matter how long it blew, there was
always more where it came from.</p>

<p>I cannot explain to an unsympathetic reader
why it was that we found life in our dusty little
metropolis so charming, and why it was that we
felt such pity for those who had never experienced
the delights of our environment. Nor can I
justify to such a reader the impulse which led
a woman whose husband had died far away in
New England to bring his body back to be laid
to rest in the bare little cemetery amid the sage
brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“It’s not such a homelike country as the other,”
I ventured.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “it isn’t, but he liked it.”</p>

<p>And so did we all; and the liking was not the
less real because it was an acquired taste. There
was nothing in it akin to serious public spirit.
It was a whimsical liking, like that of Touchstone
for Audrey,—“An ill-favoured thing, sir,
but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to
take that that no man else will.”</p>

<p>When several thousand people, set down in
the midst of a howling wilderness, tacitly agree
to consider it as the garden of the Lord, they can
do much. It pleases the ephemeral community
to make believe that it is permanent. The camp
organizes itself into a city, with all the offices and
dignities appertaining thereto. Civilization is
extemporized like a game of dumb crambo. It
amuses the citizens to see their beloved city going
about in institutions several sizes too large for it.
Nothing is taken literally. Humor is accepted
not as a private possession, but as a public trust,
and cultivated in a spirit of generous coöperation.</p>

<p>In the town were men whose education and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
experience had been in the great world. There
were mine superintendents who a little while
ago might have been in Germany or Cornwall;
there were assayers and engineers fresh from the
great technical schools, and “experts” full of
geological lore. The mines were as rich in litigation
as in silver, and there were lawyers great
and small.</p>

<p>But all were dominated by one typical character
who was accepted as the oracle of the land,—“The
Honest Miner.” To him saloons were dedicated
with alluring titles, such as “The Honest
Miner’s Delight” and “The Honest Miner’s
Rest.” At the end of the gulch was “The Honest
Miner’s Last Chance,”—one which he seldom
missed. The newspapers and political orators
appealed to his untutored judgments as the last
word of political wisdom. He occupied the position
which elsewhere is held by the “Sturdy Yeoman”
or the “Solid Business Man.”</p>

<p>The Honest Miner of the Far West is one of
those typical Americans who are builders of commonwealths.
His impress is upon the western
half of our continent. He is a nomad, the last of
a long line of adventurers to whom the delight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
of the new world is in its newness. Sometimes
his work is permanent, but he never is quite
sure. His habitual mood is one of sober satire.</p>

<p>I know nothing more pleasant than to sit with
an old-timer who has spent years in prospecting
for silver and gold, and listen to his reminiscences.
Here is a philosopher indeed, one with an historic
perspective. He has the experience of the Wandering
Jew, without his world-weariness. He has
seen the rise and fall of cities and the successive
dynasties of mining kings. His life has been a
mingling of society and solitude. With his pack
upon his back he has wandered into desert places
where no man had been since the making of
the world,—at least, no man with an eye to the
main chance. A few weeks later the lonely cañon
has become populated with eager fortune-seekers.
The camp becomes a city which to the eyes of
the Honest Miner is one of the wonders of the
world. A year later he revisits the scene, and
it is as Tadmor in the Wilderness. He pauses to
refresh his mind with ancient history, and then
passes on to join in a new “excitement.” He
measures time by these excitements as the Greeks
measured it by Olympiads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>He loves to tell of the ups and downs of his
own fortune. There is no bitterness in his memory
of his failures. They relieve the record from
the monotony that belongs to assured success. His
successes are not less gratifying because, like all
things earthly, they have had a speedy ending. A
dozen times he has “struck it rich.” He has thrown
away his pick and shovel and gone below to bask
in the smiles of fortune. He has indulged in
vague dreams of going to Europe, of looking up
his family tree, and of cultivating grammar and
other fine arts. Fortune continued to smile, but
after a while her smile became sardonic, and with
a wink she said, “Time’s up!” Then the Honest
Miner would take up his pick and shovel and
return to his work, neither a sadder nor a wiser
man,—in fact, exactly the same kind of man
he was before. That Experience is a teacher is a
pedantic theory which he rejects with scorn. Experience
is not a schoolmaster, Experience is a
chum who likes to play practical jokes upon
him. Just now he has given him a tumble and
got the laugh on him. But just wait awhile!
And he chuckles to himself as he thinks how he
will outwit Experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>All the traditions of the mining country confirm
him in his point of view: Listen to what
Experience says, and then do just the opposite.
It is the unexpected that happens. The richest
diggings bear the most lugubrious names. The
Montanian delights to tell of the riches taken out
of Last Chance Gulch. The Arizonian for years
boasted of the gayety of Tombstone and the
amazing prosperity of the Total Wreck Mine.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Certain physiologists are now telling us that
the poetic praise of wine is based upon a mistake.
Alcohol, they say, is not a stimulant, but a depressant.
It does not stimulate the imagination
so much as it depresses the critical faculty so
that dullness may easily pass for wit. An idea will
occur to a sober man as being rather bright, but
before he has time to express it he sees that it is not
so. Under the inhibition of good sense he holds
his tongue and saves his reputation. But in a convivial
company the inhibition is removed. Everybody
says whatever is uppermost in his mind.
The mice play, not because they are more lively
than before, but only because the cat is away.</p>

<p>On first hearing this theory, it seemed to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
that it was the most powerful temperance argument
which could be formulated. But I am not
sure but that it leaves the matter very much
where it found it. After all, the man who is oppressed
by the dullness of his ordinary condition
would enjoy feeling brilliant, even if he were not
really so.</p>

<p>In trying to recall any specific instances of wit
and humor in my Nevada town, I am compelled
to fall back on the theory of the removal of inhibition.
Life was not more amusing there than
elsewhere,—it only seemed so. There were no
“best people” whose critical judgments inhibited
the self-expression of less favored classes. Every
one feeling at liberty to be himself and to express
his own opinion, unfailing variety was assured.
Society, being composed of all sorts and conditions
of men, was in a state of perpetual effervescence.
A very ordinary man, who elsewhere might
have passed unnoticed in a life of drudgery, became
a notable character.</p>

<p>There, for example, was Old Multitude, so
called from the many oxen attached to the huge
wagons he convoyed to the distant mines. He
was a bull-whacker of the old school. His surname<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
had long been lost in the abyss of time.
Old Multitude was not looked upon as a mere
individual. The public had adopted him, and he
had become an institution.</p>

<p>When he was about to depart, a crowd would
gather on the main street, as the inhabitants of a
little seaport town gather to watch the departure
of a ship. Old Multitude bore his honors meekly,
but he was conscious that he was the chief actor
in an important social function. There was nothing
ill-advised in his actions, and his words were
fitly chosen as he walked down the line, addressing
to each beast of his multitudinous team the
appropriate malediction. His wide vocabulary on
such occasions contrasted strangely with his usual
taciturnity. The words taken by themselves were
blood-curdling enough, but as they rose and fell
in mighty undulations it seemed as if he were intoning
a liturgy.</p>

<p>And there was Old Tansy, a bit of wreckage
from the times of ’49. There was a tradition that
Tansy had seen better days; at least, it was hard
to imagine how he could have seen worse. He
lived without visible means of support, and yet he
was not submerged. It pleased the community<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
to accept Tansy as a character worth knowing in
spite of his fallen fortunes. His obvious failings
were always clothed in soft euphemisms. No one
could say that he had ever seen him drunk, and
on the other hand no one would be so rash as to
assert that he had ever seen him sober. In the
border land between moderate drinking and inebriety,
Tansy dwelt in peace.</p>

<p>What most endeared Tansy to his fellows was
his mild religiosity, which manifested itself in
persistent church-going. He was no fair-weather
Christian. There was no occasion when he would
not desert his favorite saloon to take his accustomed
place in the back pew of the Presbyterian
church. Only once did Tansy express an opinion
in regard to the services which he so assiduously
attended. A minister passing through the town
preached a lurid sermon on the future punishment
of the wicked. He spared no materialistic
imagery to make his remarks effective. At the
close of the service Tansy, instead of going out, as
was his custom, went forward and, grasping the
minister’s hands, said in a tone of quiet satisfaction,
“Parson, it done me good.”</p>

<p>Just what the nature of the good was he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
not indicate. I suppose that there was something
in the unction of the preacher that recalled memories
of the past.</p>

<p>There was one person whom I always recall
with peculiar pleasure. To see him coming over
the divide in a cloud of dust was to see one of
the typical forms of creation. He was known, on
account of the huge pair of goggles which he
wore, as “Four-Eyed Nick.” He dwelt in a cabin
in the most desolate part of the mountain, and he
fitted his environment perfectly. He seemed as
natural a product of the soil as the sage brush, for
like it he had learned to exist where there was
very little water.</p>

<p>Great was the joy in the community when one
day Four-Eyed Nick announced that he had struck
pay ore and that he was about to celebrate his
good fortune by getting married. Every one was
intensely interested. The newspapers made an especial
feature of the approaching marriage in high
life. Nick was dazed by the sudden glare of publicity.
Who should be invited? His generous
heart rebelled against any discrimination, and he
solved his problem by saying, “Come one! Come
all!” He engaged every vehicle in the town to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
be at the disposal of such of his fellow citizens
as would honor him with their presence at his
nuptials.</p>

<p>It would have delighted the heart of Chaucer
to have seen the procession of wedding guests
wending their way over the ten miles of abominable
mountain road to Nick’s cabin. Not on the
road to Canterbury was there more variety or
more hearty good fellowship. Nick had invited
the town, and the town was bent on showing its
appreciation of the compliment. The mayor and
members of the city council, the lawyers, editors,
doctors, clergymen, gamblers, mining experts,
saloon-keepers, and honest miners all joined
heartily in doing honor to one whom they, for
the moment, agreed to consider their most distinguished
fellow citizen.</p>

<p>No one could remain long in assured obscurity.
It pleased the community to turn its
search-light now upon one member and now
upon another, and give him a brief experience
of living in the public eye. Greatness of one
sort or another was sure to be thrust upon one
in the course of the year. The choicest spirits
of the town were always collaborating in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
work of high-grade fiction, and were on the
lookout for interesting material. It would have
been churlish for any one when his turn came
to have refused to be a notability.</p>

<p>An English writer laments the fact that the
schools send out thousands of persons whose
imaginations have been stifled by the too prosaic
discipline which they have undergone. “Why,”
he says, “is it that ninety-nine persons out of a
hundred lose this faculty in the earliest period of
their childhood? It is simply because their bringing
up has consisted in the persistent inoculation
with the material facts of life, and the correspondingly
persistent elimination of all imaginative
ideas.”</p>

<p>He blames parents who give their children
mechanical toys, especially if they are well made.
Even a doll should not have too much verisimilitude.
“It would be better to place a bundle
of rags in the arms of a little girl, and tell her to
imagine it to be a baby. She would, if left to
herself with no other resource than her own fancy
learn to exercise all her dormant powers of imagination
and originality.”</p>

<p>That kind of education the Honest Miner has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
carried into mature life. He is full of imaginative
ideas. The barest shanty is glorified in his
eyes if it bears the sign “Palace Hotel” or “Delmonico’s.”
If he cannot have the thing, he takes
satisfaction in the name. Above all else, he craves
variety.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Gold Hill used to relate
with pleasure the exploits of Sandy Bowers.
When he struck an incredibly rich pocket in the
mountain, Sandy built for himself a huge and
expensive mansion in Washoe Valley. He imported
all kinds of trees from foreign lands, none
of which would grow. He filled his house with
pianos, and when some one suggested sheet music
he telegraphed to New York: “Send me
some sheet music, one of every kind.”</p>

<p>It was the desire for one of every kind which
induced our community, when it put off the
habits of a “camp” and became a “city,” to lift
into temporary prominence an elderly farmer
from Pennsylvania who had drifted into Nevada
without changing any of his ways. He came
from York County, where he would have gone on
his way unnoticed, for there were so many like
him. But in the silver country he was different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
from the common run of fortune-seekers, therefore
he was made much of. Some local Diogenes
turned his lantern upon him and discovered that
he was an honest man, honest in a plodding,
Pennsylvania Dutch fashion. “Honest John”
became a man of note. Then some one suggested
that we had “in our midst a grand old man.”
That was enough to make the political fortune
of the honest man. He was elected to a position
of power in the new city government, for every
one was anxious to see what our “grand old
man” would do.</p>

<p>He proved a thorn in the flesh of the politicians.
He introduced a reign of rigid economy
which made the local statesmen despair of the
Republic. It was decided that the city had had
too much of a good thing. The Grand Old
Man should be deposed,—he should not be
mayor, nor member of the council, nor any such
thing.</p>

<p>But the municipal charter had been conceived
in that generous fashion which is proper to a state
where there are offices in excess of the needs of the
population. The Grand Old Man discovered that
there was one office which had been overlooked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
by the astute politicians: that of the Superintendent
of Streets and Sidewalks. The streets had
not been clearly differentiated from the surrounding
desert, and, as for sidewalks, the citizens had
been accustomed to cut across the country wherever
it pleased them. The highways having been
left to the kindly influence of Nature, it never
occurred to any one that they should be officially
superintended. The Grand Old Man cast a ballot
for himself as Superintendent of Streets and Sidewalks,
and when the returns were in, it was found
that his name led all the rest. He was declared
elected by a majority of one.</p>

<p>Then he began to magnify his office. He
brought forth a plan of the city which had heretofore
been a dead letter. He discovered streets
where the wildest imagination had not supposed
streets to be possible. Prominent citizens were
arrested for obstructing mythical sidewalks. He
was encouraged to stretch his prerogatives to the
utmost, for every one was curious to see how far
they would go. For six months he ruled by right
of eminent domain. Leading lawyers gave it as
their opinion that all rights not expressly reserved
by the Federal and State governments were vested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
in the Grand Old Man. The Methodist minister,
who was inclined to sensationalism, preached a
sermon from the text in Nehemiah vi. 6: “It is
reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it.”
“Who this Gashmu was,” said the preacher, in beginning
his discourse, “we do not know, but from
the importance attributed to his remarks we may
fairly assume that he was the Superintendent of
Streets and Sidewalks in Jerusalem.”</p>

</div>


<p>He had in mind the backwoodsmen whom
sturdy apostles like Peter Cartwright labored
with to such good purpose. But the Honest
Miner, though a pioneer, is not a backwoodsman.
His humor is of a different quality. He would
not think of slapping Cæsar on the back and
calling him “Old Horse.” It would seem more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
amusing to him to address some one who might
properly be called “Old Horse” with titles of
honor.</p>

<p>“Truthful James” delights in euphemism. He
does not object to calling a spade a spade, but he
refuses to do so in such a way as to give offense.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p>He is no “brown-fisted rough” who delights in
swagger. There is roughness enough all about
him, and it pleases him to cultivate the amenities.
His gentlemanliness is often carried to excess.</p>

<p>The most characteristic humor of the Honest
Miner consists, not in grotesque exaggeration, but
in delicate understatement. What can be more
considerate than the notice posted by the side
of an open shaft: “Gentlemen will please not
fall down this shaft, for there are men at work
below.”</p>

<p>A Nevada minister once described to me the
action of a brother minister in the early days. The
minister went to a certain town where he offended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
the lawless element, and was threatened with
physical violence if he persisted in his intention
of preaching. My friend described the method
by which the liberty of prophesying was asserted.
“He went into the pulpit, laid his revolver on
the Bible—and then he preached <i>extempore</i>.”</p>

<p>The manner of narration savored of the soil.
The Honest Miner under such circumstances
would subordinate everything to emphasis on the
correct homiletical method. No matter how able
the minister might be, it was evident that if he
were closely confined to his notes, his delivery
could not be effective.</p>

<p>A good woman described the way in which her
minister, a young man fresh from the theological
school, made one of his first parish calls. He
found his parishioner, who had been extolled as
one of the pillars of the church, in a state of intoxication,
and he was chased out of the house
and some distance down the street.</p>

<p>“We were sorry it happened, for it gave him
an unpleasant impression of the congregation.
You know Mr. —— met with several rebuffs.”</p>

<p>The unconventional episode was related with
all the prim propriety of “Cranford.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>The perfect democracy of a mining camp develops
a certain naïve truth-telling, which has
all the unexpectedness which belongs to the
observations of a boy. There is no attempt to
reduce everything to uniformity, or to prove any
particular thesis. The gossip of a conventional
village where people know each other too well
is apt to be malicious. A creditable action is
narrated, and then comes the inevitable “but.”
The subject of conversation falls in the estimation
of the hearers with a sudden thud.</p>

<p>The Honest Miner does not attempt to pass
final judgment or to arrange his fellow men according
to any sort of classification. He speaks
of them as he sees them, and so virtues and failings
jostle one another and take no offense. The
result is a moral inconsequence which has all
the effect of studied wit. This is what delights us
in the characterization of Thompson of Angel’s:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Frequently drunk was Thompson, but always polite to the stranger.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>As we read the line we smile, not so much at
Thompson as at the society of which he was a
part. We see behind him the sympathetic company
at Angel’s. Here was a public with whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
temper he was familiar. He could trust himself
to the judgment of his peers. No misdemeanor
would blind them to such virtues as he actually
possessed. He could appeal to them with perfect
confidence.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</div>

<p>The Western mining camp is not primarily
an educational institution, yet it has served a
most important function in the making of Americans.
The young man is fortunate who on leaving
college can take a post-graduate course in
a community where he can study sociology at
first hand. He will learn many things, especially
that human nature is not so simple as it seems,
but that it has many “dips, spurs, and angles.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c8">A SAINT RECANONIZED</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap1">A</span>LL the world loves a lover,” but all the
world does not love a saint. Our hearts
do not leap up when we behold a halo on the title-page,
and so the lives of the heroes of the Church
are frequently neglected. When the saint has
been duly canonized, that is generally the end of
him in popular esteem. But sometimes the ecclesiastical
and secular judgments coincide and the
saint is invested with human interest.</p>

<p>So it has been with St. Francis of Assisi,—given
the highest honors in his church, he has
captivated the imagination of the world. Protestants
vie with Catholics in doing him honor. At
no time has his name been more familiar or his
legend more often repeated than in our own
day. He has been recanonized.</p>

<p>This renewal of interest in the Franciscan legend
is all the more interesting because it carries
us into a region so remote from that in which we
habitually dwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Now it came to pass that as Francis, the servant
of the Lord, was singing the praises of the
Lord with joy and gladness, certain robbers fell
upon him and fiercely questioned him who he was.
And he answered, ‘I am the herald of the King
of Heaven.’ And the robbers fell upon him with
blows and cast him into a ditch, saying, ‘Lie there,
thou herald of nothing!’ When they had departed
Francis arose and went through the forest,
singing with a loud voice the praises of the
Creator.”</p>

<p>These words take us into another world than
ours. To enter that world we must not only lay
aside our easily besetting sins, but our easily besetting
virtues as well. We must cast aside all
the prudential virtues, we must rid our minds of
all prejudice in favor of scientific charity and rationalistic
schemes of philanthropy, and we must
disclaim personal responsibility for the progress
of modern civilization. With such impedimenta
the pilgrim of thought might possibly get as far
back as the sixteenth century, but it would be
impossible for him to penetrate into the thirteenth.
He who would do so must first drink deep of
Lethe. He must put out of mind those persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
and events which have been the distinctive influences
of the modern world. He must forget
Luther, and wash his soul clean of every trace
of Calvin; every echo of the raillery of Voltaire
must have died away, and his mind must have
been kept unspotted from the world of Newton
and of Darwin.</p>

<p>Above all, if he would enter into the social
dreams of the thirteenth century, he must forget
that he ever heard of such a science as political
economy. He must renounce the old Adam and
all his works,—I mean Adam Smith.</p>

<p>But on the other side of Lethe there are pure
fountains, and dark forests where robbers lurk,
and where saints are singing the high praises of
God, and beyond are the “regions dim of rapture”
where they are lost from the eyes of their
disciples.</p>

<p>And it may not be in vain to turn aside from
the consideration of the engrossing questions of
our day, to enter into that dim world and look
out upon it through the eyes of its truest saints.
They were eyes blind to many things we see
clearly, but they saw some things which we do
not always see; at any rate they were eyes—</p>

</div>


<p>So Francis of Assisi has an especial interest for
every student of Christianity and for every student
of ethics. For the student of Christianity he
stands as a man who, while neither a theologian
nor a reformer, and having no place among the
intellectual leaders of mankind, has an undisputed
spiritual leadership. His place is that of
the little child whom Jesus placed in the midst
and of whom he said, “Of such is the kingdom
of Heaven.”</p>

<p>For the student of ethics St. Francis is of interest
because, while he had an invincible ignorance
of scientific ethics, yet the real emphasis of his
life and teaching was on the finest kind of ethical
idealism. We are reminded of Shakespeare’s
lines:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love is too young to know what conscience is,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet who knows not that conscience is born of love.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>There are some characters, and St. Francis is
among them, who belong so completely to their
own age that we cannot take them out of their
environment. The beauty of their lives is like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
that of some shy wild flower which will not bear
transplanting. If we would enjoy it we must go
where it grows. To appreciate these characters we
need not critical knowledge, but imaginative sympathy.</p>

<p>There is an old Irish legend of a young hero
who sailed to a far country and married a beautiful
princess. Living there he enjoyed perpetual
youth, and three centuries passed away as if they
had been but three years. Then came a longing
to return to his own native land. After much
entreating his fair wife allowed him to return on
one condition, and that was that he should not
dismount from the white steed she gave him.
The prince came back, but riding in youthful
strength and beauty through the familiar land, at
last he forgot the condition. Dismounting, his
feet touched the ground, and the enchantment
vanished. Suddenly he realized the passage of
time. His friends, the heroes of his youth, were
dead and forgotten. He was very old; his strength
had withered away. The joyous paganism in
which he had been bred had been driven away.
He saw processions of monks and nuns, and heard
the sound of church bells, and saw over all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
shadow of the cross. He belonged to the old order
that had passed away, now the destinies of the
land were in the hands of new men.</p>

<p>Something of this same caution must be used
by those who would see the St. Francis whom the
people long ago loved and worshiped. He is
the embodiment of mediæval goodness. Let us
beware of disenchanting literalism, lest suddenly
the radiant youth disappear and we see only the
relic of an age that has passed away.</p>

<p>Let us not look back at St. Francis. Let us
stand at the beginning of the thirteenth century
and look forward. Let us share the dream of
the youth who went through the forest singing
the praise of God.</p>

<p>The transformation of worldly ambition into
spiritual was never more vividly told than in the
legend of St. Francis, by the Three Companions.
We see Francis the gay son of Peter Bernardone,
merchant of Assisi, transformed into a knight of
Lady Poverty.</p>

<p>“Then a few years later a certain noble of the
city of Assisi provided himself with warlike gear
to go into Apulia to increase his profit of money
and renown. Upon hearing this, Francis did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
aspire to go with him and to be made a knight
by a certain count, Gentile by name; wherefore
he made ready stuffs as costly as he could, poorer
in riches than his fellow citizen, but more profuse
in largesse. One night when he had given all
his thoughts to bringing this to pass, and was
fevered with the desire for making the journey,
he was visited by the Lord, who draweth him as
one eager for glory to the pinnacle of glory by a
vision and uplifteth him. For while sleeping that
night one appeared unto him, calling him by
name, and leading him into the palace of a fair
bride, very pleasant and full of knightly armor,
to wit, glittering shields and other apparel hanging
on the wall as it were waiting for knights to
accoutre them therewithal. And while he, rejoicing
greatly, marveled silently within himself what
this might be, he asked whose were these arms
flashing with such splendor and this so pleasant
palace? And the answer was made him that the
palace and all things therein were his own and his
knights’. And thus awakening with joyous heart
he rose early.... And so much gayer than his
wont did he seem that many wondered thereat,
and asked whence had he such joy, unto whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
he would reply, “I know that I shall be a great
prince.”</p>

<p>It was not the sense of sin that proved the
beginning of a new life to this light-hearted Italian.
It was rather the sense of a higher chivalry.
Another vision came to him. A voice asked,
“‘Which can do the better for thee, the lord or
the servant?’</p>

<p>“And when he answered, ‘The lord,’ that other
said again unto him, ‘Wherefore then dost thou
leave the lord for the servant, and a rich lord for
a poor?’... Then waking he began earnestly to
ponder this vision. And just as in the first vision
he had been, as it were, quite carried out of
himself for his great joy, coveting worldly good
fortune, so in this vision he withdrew within himself
entirely, wondering at its might, and meditating
so earnestly that he could sleep no more
that night.”</p>

<p>At last the new vision took form in an enthusiastic
way of life. In the church Francis heard
the words of the gospels, “Take no gold nor
silver nor money in your purses, nor two coats,
nor shoes, nor staff.”</p>

<p>No further did he need to listen. Throwing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
away his purse, and putting on the garb of a
peasant, he devoted himself henceforth not simply
to the service of the poor, but to the worship
of Poverty. Dante in memorable words described
this lover-like devotion.</p>

<p>Francis and Poverty—these lovers seem
strange indeed to twentieth-century eyes. An age
when philanthropy strives for the abolition of
poverty and invites enlightened self-interest to its
aid cannot readily understand one who welcomed
poverty as a blessed condition. “No man,” said a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
disciple of St. Francis, “was ever so covetous of
wealth as he of poverty.”</p>

<p>We hear St. Francis discoursing with brother
Leo concerning perfect bliss. It lies not in knowledge
or power or even in the ability to convert
the infidels to the Holy Faith. “When we shall
come to St. Mary of the Angels dripping with
rain and tormented with cold and hunger, and we
shall knock at the door, and the porter shall say,
‘Who are ye?’ and we shall answer, ‘We are
your brethren,’ and he shall say, ‘You lie, you are
two knaves that go about deceiving the people
and stealing from the poor’—if, when he leaves
us in the cold and wet we shall patiently endure,
and say within ourselves, ‘Perhaps the porter
reads us aright,’ then, O brother Leo, thou mayest
say, ‘Herein lies perfect bliss.’”</p>

<p>We hear the passionate prayer, “O Lord Jesus,
point out to me the ways of poverty which were
so dear to thee. O Jesus, who chosest to be poor,
the favor I ask of thee is to give me the privilege
of poverty and to be enriched by thy blessing.”</p>

<p>This was not the temper of ordinary asceticism.
St. Francis was in temper more an Epicurean than
a Stoic. He was a lover of pleasure and was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
content with any kind of pleasure short of what
he conceived to be the highest. The ascetic was
interested primarily in the salvation of his own
soul. Wealth and comfort were the temptations
of the devil to cheat him of his future reward.
The hermit accepted poverty as the hard road to
Heaven; to St. Francis it was Heaven itself.</p>

<p>“Property is robbery,” he would have said, but
not in the sense in which a modern communist
would use the words. It is the robbery not of
one’s neighbor but of one’s self. We take for
granted that wealth is a good thing and poverty
an evil. No, St. Francis would say, there is no
good thing but what is good for the soul. It is
good to be humble, sympathetic, and thankful.
It is good to be conscious of God’s presence
everywhere and to be close to the lowliest of his
creatures. The means of this grace are nearer to
the peasant than to the prince. There are some
things that wealth buys. The rich man has his
comforts, his sheltered home, his group of friends
and dependents, his servants and his wide estates;
his is the meekness that inherits the earth.</p>

<p>St. Francis found joy in the sacrifices and austerities
which to others were so painful. The predominant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
note is that of gladness. In the midst
of his penances he is light-hearted. He interpreted
more literally than we do the words, “Take no
thought for the morrow.” Some things are possible
in Umbria and Galilee that seem wildly impracticable
under the fickle skies of New England.
The sober prose of religion may be translated into
all languages and verified by all human experience,
but there is an idyllic poetry of religion that
belongs only to the climate where that poetry
had birth. “The Little Flowers of St. Francis”
grew out of the same kindly soil and under the
same friendly skies that nourished the lilies that
Jesus loved.</p>

<p>St. Francis always wore his halo with an easy
grace. In spite of his scourgings and fastings he
was blithe and debonair. He was saint-errant, as
full of romance as any knight-errant of them all.
He was a lover of spiritual adventure, and delighted
to attempt the impossible.</p>

<p>To St. Francis voluntary poverty meant spiritual
freedom. The preacher was no longer dependent
on powerful patrons or rich parishioners
or even on the fickle multitudes. The missionary
did not need a missionary board. He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
have to wait for a church building to be erected
and a pulpit to be prepared. Even a hermitage
was a superfluity. “The true hermit,” said St.
Francis, “carries his cell about with him.” And
so he and his disciples preached and asked no
man’s leave. Through all the byways of Italy
they wandered, proclaiming that God was in
the fields as well as in the churches. Entering a
village Brother Francis would say, “Love God
and repent, good people. Love God and do penance.”
And Brother Egidio would say, “Yes,
good people, do as Brother Francis says, for he
says what is right.”</p>

<p>And if there were no people to preach to there
were always our sisters, the birds, and now and
then there was a wicked wolf who would yield to
moral suasion. We smile at this way of preaching
to every creature, but it is as we smile at the
idiosyncrasies of one we love.</p>

<p>Many a preacher who has confined his preaching
to human kind has put less good sense into
his sermons and shown less insight into the causes
of sin than did Francis in his discourse to the
wolf of Gubbio. The inhabitants who had suffered
from his depredations hated him for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
wolfish iniquities. The saint saw that the cause
of the evil was economic rather than moral. He
was a right-minded wolf; the trouble was that he
was hungry. St. Francis entered into a covenant
of peace with him.</p>

<p>“‘Brother Wolf, inasmuch as it pleases you to
make and keep this peace, I promise you that so
long as you shall live you shall not suffer hunger,
forasmuch as I am aware that hunger has caused
your every crime. But since I have got for you
this grace, I require, Brother Wolf, your promise
never again to do harm to any human being,
neither to any beast. Do you promise?’ And
St. Francis stretching forth his hand, the wolf
uplifted his right paw and gave him the pledge
of faith as best he could.”</p>

<p>It was in the same spirit that St. Francis
went forth on his mission to the Sultan. The
Crusaders had gone forth to destroy the infidels.
Francis, in the simplicity of his heart, thought the
better way would be to convert them. Neither
way proved to be altogether effective, but certainly
the latter plan was the more Christian.</p>

<p>In the history of preaching there have been
many vicissitudes. Sometimes the preacher has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
been a philosopher, sometimes an advocate, sometimes
he has adopted the tone of a man of business.
In the preaching of St. Francis we are taken
back to the time of the wandering minstrels.</p>

<p>“So great was the sweetness and consolation
of his spirit that he called for Brother Pacificus
whom the world entitled the King of Verse and
Courteous Doctor of Song, and desired to send
him with the other friars to go together through
the world, preaching and singing the “Praises of
the Lord.” And he desired that he among them
who was the best preacher should first preach to
the people, and when the sermon was ended all
the others should sing together the “Praises of the
Lord,” as the Lord’s minstrels; and at the end
he desired the preacher should say to the people,
‘We are the Lord’s minstrels, and the reward we
ask of you is that you turn to true repentance.’”</p>

<p>No wonder that the people loved Brother Francis
when he brought religion to them in such a
fashion, and that there would gather around him</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent7">As may be read of in Arcadian books.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>With all his saintly austerities St. Francis
was always a gentleman. Even the most admiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
biographers cannot hide his humanness. The
Lives of the Saints do not contain many such
incidents as that in the chapter in “The Mirror
of Perfection” entitled “How he comforted a
Sick Friar by eating Grapes with Him.” It was a
little thing to do, but I am sure that St. Dominic
would never have thought of it. The friar had
been overdoing the mortification of the flesh, and
had fallen ill. “Blessed Francis said to himself:
‘If that friar would eat ripe grapes in the morning
I believe he would be cured!’ And as he
thought so he did. Rising early in the morning,
he called the friar secretly, and took him to a
vineyard near the place, and choosing a vine that
had good grapes fit for eating, he sat down by the
vine with the friar and began to eat grapes, that
the friar should not be ashamed of eating alone....
And all the days of his life this friar remembered
the pity and compassion shown him by the
blessed Father, and would relate what had happened
to the other friars.”</p>

<p>It was an age of miracles, but St. Francis never
allowed them to clutter up his little world. They
must keep their place. When Brother Peter died
in great sanctity, he was immediately worshiped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
as a saint. Great crowds came to his tomb, and
many miracles were wrought. This was well, but
there must be a measure in all things. So one day
St. Francis went to the door of the tomb, and his
most persuasive voice said, “Brother Peter, in
your lifetime you gave perfect obedience. Know
that your brethren are disturbed by the crowds
that come to your tomb. I command you, by
holy obedience, that you work no more miracles.”
And from that day Brother Peter abstained from
any interference with the order of nature.</p>

<p>A true son of the Church, yet because of the
unworldliness of his nature Francis from the first
transcended the sphere of ecclesiasticism, and lived
in the freedom of the spirit. In an age when ritualism
was triumphant he chose an unsacerdotal
ministry. At a time when the highest piety was
supposed to manifest itself in the building and
adornment of churches, he insisted on the higher
grace of charity. When a case of need was presented
to him, he said: “Sell the ornaments on
the altar of the Blessed Virgin. Be assured that
she would be more pleased to have her altar without
adornment than to see the gospel of her Son
any longer set at naught.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Pope Innocent had many who came with ambitious
plans. There were always monks who
desired to be abbots, and priests who desired to
be bishops. But one day Brother Francis came
desiring that he and certain poor brethren might
be allowed to live according to the rule of the
gospel. They were not content to be poor after
the conventional fashion of the great monastic institutions,
where corporate wealth was married to
individual poverty. Their poverty should be real.
Almost everything had been organized around a
treasury. They would like to organize brotherly
kindness, patience, humility, and love according
to their own laws.</p>

<p>And the request was made so simply that Pope
Innocent could do nothing but grant it, though
it made his own ambitions stand out in startling
contrast.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>The life of St. Francis was very mediæval,
which was but another way of saying that its
idealism was not balanced by the scientific temper.
Men in those days delighted in paradoxes,
and were contented with no half measures. His
experience was different from ours. He did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
confront the poverty of the slums of our great
cities. It was the poverty of Umbria. It was a
poverty that was acquainted with hunger and
which wore coarse garments, but it had the freedom
of the fields and the open roads. We
have problems to solve with which he was unacquainted.</p>

<p>Yet there is something in his daring paradox
which attracts us. Beneath all its extravagance
there is a vitality in the joyous worship of My
Lady Poverty. For what is worship? It is, literally,
worth-ship. It is the recognition of intrinsic
values. It is just here that the modern man is
beginning to be distrustful of himself. He has
been marvelously successful in obtaining his desires,
but has he desired the best things? In the
height of his achievement he cannot help asking,
“After all, is it worth what it has cost?”</p>

<p>Things turn out differently from what had been
expected. A life devoted to personal gain is
likely to be disappointing. A whole community
which has no other means of estimating worth
than the increase in wealth is still more disappointing.
It has no proper means of government.
A plutocracy is but another name for moral anarchy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Special interests become intolerably domineering
and override the common good. In a
society where everything is measured by money,
where is the limitation to despotism? What
is to prevent the rich man from buying up his
neighbors and using all their talents to serve his
own narrow purposes? He is able to pay for the
best food and drink and shelter. Why may he
not bend to his will the best human ability?</p>

<p>The answer comes from the iconoclasts, who
strike boldly at the idols of the market-place.
They have something that is not for sale, and they
can afford to laugh at the highest bidders. They
are not asking favors. They are likely to be inexperienced
in the ways of the world, but the
world fears them as it fears all forces which it
cannot understand. They cannot be cajoled or
threatened, for they have learned that it is possible
to be happy and poor.</p>

<p>My Lady Poverty has still her worshipers.
She has long been honored by the devotion of
true artists. The man of science gravely acknowledges
her, and confesses without shame that he is
too busy to make money. There are statesmen
who are the despair of the party managers because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
when the question comes, “What can we do for
you?” they answer “Nothing.” Every now and
then there occurs that disconcerting phenomenon
which we call genius. It upsets all calculations
and refuses to respond to the law of supply and
demand. The second best may be bought, but the
very best is given away. Now and then, too, out
of our conventional gentilities there comes an
ideal gentleman. He would adorn the most exclusive
circles, were it not that he has a passion
for the best society, and he has learned that the
best society is never exclusive. He takes the part
of the uttermost man, and finds his joy in the companionship
of those who are aspiring and struggling.
And there is the increasing number of the
nature-lovers who enter into the religious feelings
which St. Francis voiced in “The Song of the
Creatures.” They love one who could worship
out of doors, and speak familiarly of Master Sun
and Brother Wind and Sister Water. As they sit
around their campfires they join heartily in the
praise of Brother Fire. “He is jocund, robust,
and strong and bright.”</p>

<p>They love to read again the story of how St.
Francis and Brother Masseo stopped at noon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
under a tree where there was a broad smooth stone
to serve as a table for their simple meal. Close
by was a spring of cold water.</p>

<p>“What a treasure we have here!” cried Francis
in delight.</p>

<p>“Father,” answered Brother Masseo, “how can
you talk so when we have no tablecloth or knife
or cup!”</p>

<p>Brother Masseo voices the opinion of the majority,
but there are increasing numbers of true
Franciscans. St. Francis is the patron saint of
those who believe in Nature as well as in Grace.
In spite of all his austerities he is endeared to us
because he represented the bohemianism of piety.</p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE exercises of Commencement Day had
been unusually interesting, though prolonged.
I had attended them all. I had listened
to the wisdom of the selected members of the
graduating class, and afterwards to the less dignified
but more optimistic remarks of the old graduates.
The general impression that I received
was that though the country had been in danger,
the worst was over.</p>

<p>Returning home I found a caller waiting for me
in the library. He was a rather handsome man in
his way, but a close observer might have noticed
a certain shiftiness in his eyes and hard lines about
his mouth, and perhaps other signs of a misspent
life. Not being a close observer, I did not notice
any of these things. He struck me as an ordinary
person with whom it might be a pleasure to talk.
I was somewhat surprised at his first remark,
which was made by way of introduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>“I am,” he said, “well known to the police,
and am said to be the most dangerous criminal of
my class now at large. I am an expert forger and
have served time in four prisons.”</p>

<p>His frank statement was preliminary to the request
for a temporary loan that would enable him
to complete the work of reformation, that was endangered
by a lack of funds. It was late in the
day, and before acceding to his request it was
necessary that there should be some investigation,
so I asked him to call on the morrow.</p>

<p>“I have been at the Commencement exercises
all day,” I said, “and am not in a condition to be
of much help to you just now; but if you would
like to stay a while and chat, I should be glad.”</p>

<p>He welcomed the suggestion, and, now that the
matter of business had been postponed, he was at
his ease. In a friendly way he made me acquainted
with the general theory of forging and check-raising,—at
least so far as it is intelligible to the lay
mind. His criticism of prison management was
acute, and he pointed out the seamy side of the
plans of the reformers. I listened with docility to
his story of the under world. He was a well-educated
man with an appreciation of good literature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
which was a characteristic, he informed me, of most
forgers. He was especially interested in sociology,
and had all its best phrases at his tongue’s end. He
attributed all his misfortunes to Society. For one
thing I listened in vain,—the admission that in
some respects he might himself have been remiss.
The idea of reciprocal obligation did not seem to
have any place in his philosophy. As delicately
as I could I tried to turn the conversation from
the sin of Society, which I readily acknowledged,
to the less obvious point of personal responsibility.
Granting that Society was imperfectly
organized, that juries were ignorant, and judges
lacking in the quality of mercy, and prison wardens
harsh, and chaplains too simple-minded, were
there not faults on the other side that it might
be profitable to correct? It was of no use to try
to induce such currents of thought; they were
quickly short-circuited.</p>

<p>At last I said, “You have told me what you
did before you concluded to reform. I am curious
to know how, in those days, you looked at
things. Was there anything which you wouldn’t
have done, not because you were afraid of the
law, but because you felt it would be wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “there is one thing I never
would do, because it always seemed low down.
I never would steal.”</p>

<p>It was evident that further discussion would be
unprofitable without definition of terms. I found
that by stealing he meant petty larceny, which he
abhorred. In our condemnation of the sneak thief
and the pickpocket we were on common ground.
His feeling of reprobation was, if anything, more
intense than that which I felt at the time. He
alluded to the umbrellas and other portable articles
he had noticed in the hallway. Any one
who would take advantage of an unsuspecting
householder by purloining such things was a degenerate.
He had no dealings with such moral
imbeciles.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I might press the analogy
which instantly occurred to me between “stealing”
and forgery.</p>

<p>“Do they not,” I said, “seem to you to amount
to very much the same thing?”</p>

<p>I had struck a wrong note. Analogies are
ticklish things to handle, for things which are
alike in certain respects are apt to be quite different
in other respects. His mind was intent on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
the differences. The sneak thief, he told me, is
a vulgar fellow of no education. The forger and
the check-raiser are experts. They are playing
a game. Their wits are pitted against the wits of
the men who are paid high salaries for detecting
them. They belong to quite different spheres. If
we are looking for analogies we should look up
and not down.</p>

<p>“You wanted to know,” he said, “what was
the difference between stealing and check-raising.
Now, let me ask you a question. What’s the
difference between check-raising and some of
those big financial operations we’ve all been reading
about? Suppose I have a check for five
dollars, and I put my brains into it and I manipulate
it so that I can pass it off for five hundred.
I shove it in to the cashier and he takes it.
Before he finds out his mistake, I have made
myself scarce. What’s the difference between
that transaction and what the ‘big fellows’ on the
street are doing?” He mentioned several names
that I had not thought of in that connection.</p>

<p>“The difference,” said I, “is—” Then it occurred
to me that it was a subject to which I
should give further thought. So we postponed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
the conversation till he should call again—which
he never did.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>I may be doing injustice to my friend the
forger, but he gave me the impression that he
considered himself to be, on the whole, a rather
admirable character. His proposed change of
business seemed to be rather a concession to the
prejudices of the legal profession than the result
of any personal scruple. As he saw himself
he was a man of idealistic temper whose ideals
conflicted with social usage. Society was all the
time getting into his way, and in the inevitable
collisions he had usually the worst of it. He
regretted this, but he bore no malice. By the
time a man has reached middle life and accumulated
a good deal of experience he takes the world
as he finds it.</p>

<p>He had encased himself in a moral system
which was self-consistent and which explained to
his own satisfaction all that had happened to him.
One thing fitted into another, and there was no
room for self-reproach.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to depict the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
character of an accomplished scamp. But Gil Blas
and Roderick Random and Jonathan Wild the
Great are after all seen from the outside. The
author may attempt to do them justice, but there
is a vein of irony that reveals a judgment of his
own. They lack the essential element of incorrigibility,
which is that the scamp does not suspect
himself, has not found himself out.</p>

<p>No novelist has ever been able to give such a
portraiture of a complacent criminal as was given
a century ago in the autobiography of Stephen
Burroughs.</p>

<p>Burroughs was the son of a worthy clergyman
of Hanover, New Hampshire, and from the outset
was looked upon as a black sheep. As a mere
boy he ran away from home and joined the army,
and then with equal irresponsibility deserted. He
became a ship’s surgeon, a privateersman, then a
self-ordained minister, a counterfeiter, a teacher
of youth, a founder of libraries, and a miscellaneous
philanthropist. He was a patriot and an
optimist and an enthusiastic worker in the cause
of general education. He was chock-full of fine
sentiment and had a gift for its expression. He
enjoyed doing good, though in his own way, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
never neglected any opportunity to rebuke those
who he felt were in the wrong. He had a desire
to reform the world, and had no doubt of the plans
which he elaborated. He was capable on occasions
of acts of magnanimity, which, while not
appreciated by the public, gave him great pleasure
in the retrospect. The intervals between his
various enterprises were spent in New England
jails. These experiences only deepened his love of
liberty, which was one of the passions of his life.</p>

<p>Burroughs had a happy disposition that enabled
him to get a measure of satisfaction out of all the
vicissitudes of his life. He had learned neither
to worry nor to repine. He was not troubled by
the harsh judgments of his fellow men, for he had
learned to find his happiness in the approbation
of his own conscience.</p>

<p>He writes: “I possess an uncommon share
of sensibility, and at the same time maintain an
equality of mind that is uncommon, particularly
in the midst of those occurrences which are calculated
to wound the feelings. I have learned
fortitude in the school of adversity. In draining
the cup of bitterness to its dregs, I have been
taught to despise the occurrences of misfortune.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
This one thing I fully believe, that our happiness
is more in our power than is generally thought,
or at least we have the ability of preventing that
misery which is so common to unfortunate situations.
No state or condition in life, but from
which we may (if we exercise that reason which
the God of Nature has given us) draw comfort
and happiness. We are too apt to be governed
by the opinions of others, and if they think our
circumstances unhappy, to consider them so ourselves,
and of course make them so. The state of
mind is the only criterion of happiness or misery.”</p>

<p>It was from this lofty point of view that Stephen
Burroughs wrote the history of his own life.
His tendency to didacticism interferes with the
limpid flow of the narrative. Sometimes a whole
chapter will be given over to moralizings, but the
observations are never painful. They all reveal
the author’s cheerful acquiescence in the inevitability
of his own actions. Along with this there
is the air of chastened surprise over the fact that
he was made the object of persecution.</p>

<p>At the very beginning of the narrative one recognizes
an independence which would do credit
to a better man. In New England, clergymen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
have always been looked upon as making good
ancestors, and Burroughs might have been pardoned
if he had shown some family pride. From
this weakness he was free. “I am,” he says, “the
only son of a clergyman, living in Hanover, in
the State of New Hampshire; and were any
to expect merit from their parentage, I might
justly look for that merit. But I am so far a Republican
that I consider a man’s merit to rest
entirely with himself, without any regard to
family, blood, or connection.”</p>

<p>The accounts of the escapades of his boyhood
are intermingled with dissertations on the education
of youth. “I have been in the habit of educating
youth for seven years, constantly; in the
course of my business I have endeavored to study
the operations of the human heart, that I might
be able to afford that instruction which would be
salutary; and in this I find one truth clearly established,
viz.: a child will endeavor to be what
you make him think mankind in general are.”</p>

<p>The neglect of this truth on the part of his
parents and teachers was the cause of much annoyance
to Burroughs. Throughout his life he was
the innocent victim of an educational mistake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
Though after a while he learned to forgive the early
injustice, one can see that it rankled. He endeavored
to think well of mankind in general, but it
was more difficult than if he had been habituated
to the exercise in infancy.</p>

<p>At Dartmouth young Burroughs was peculiarly
unfortunate; he fell into bad company. As
an unkind fate would have it, his room-mate was
an exemplary young man who was studying for
the ministry. It appears that this misguided youth
attempted to entice him into what he describes as
“a sour, morose, and misanthropic line of conduct.”
Nothing could have been more disastrous.
“To be an inmate with such a character, you will
readily conceive, no way comported with a disposition
like mine, and consequently we never
enjoyed that union and harmony of feeling in our
intercourse as room-mates which was necessary
for the enjoyment of social life.”</p>

<p>To the malign influence of his priggish room-mate
several misfortunes were attributed. In endeavoring
to restore the moral equilibrium which
had been disturbed by the too great scrupulosity
of his chum, he exerted too much strength in the
other direction. The result was that “a powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
triumvirate” was formed against him in the Faculty.
The triumvirate triumphed and his connection
with Dartmouth ended suddenly.</p>

<p>This gave occasion to a chapter on the failure
of the institutions of learning to prepare for real
life. The author declares “more than one half
of the time spent in the universities, according
to their present establishment on this continent,
is thrown away, and that my position is founded
in fact I will endeavor to prove.”</p>

<p>I do not see how his argument is affected by
the fact to which the editor calls attention in a
carping footnote. “It is not strange that the author
should reason in this manner. He was expelled
from college in the second quarter of his
second year, and in fact he studied but little while
he was a member.” The editor, I fear, had a narrow
mind and judged according to an academic
standard which Burroughs would have despised.</p>

<p>From the uncongenial limitations of a college
town it was a satisfaction to escape to sea. Here
Burroughs’s versatility stood him in good stead.
“Having no doctor engaged, I undertook to act
in that capacity; and after obtaining the assistance,
advice, and direction of an old practitioner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
together with marks set on each parcel of medicine,
I thought myself tolerably well qualified to
perform the office of a physician on board the ship.”</p>

<p>From his seafaring life Burroughs returned
with his reputation under a cloud. There were
ugly rumors afloat which were readily believed
by a censorious world. For once he confesses
that his philosophy failed him. “I returned to
my father’s house sunken and discouraged; the
world appeared a gloomy chaos; the sun arose
to cast a sickly glimmer on surrounding objects;
the flowers of the field insulted my feelings with
their gayety and splendor; the frolicsome lamb,
the playful kitten, and the antic colt were beheld
with those painful emotions which are beyond
description. Shall all nature, shall the brute creation
break out into irregular transports, by the
overflowing of pleasing sensations, whilst I am
shut out from even the dim rays of hope?”</p>

<p>Certainly not. To a mind constituted as was
his there was an absurdity in the very suggestion.
The brute creation should not have any monopoly
of comfortable sensations, so he cheered up
immediately and spent the next year loafing
around his father’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>He had been on the coast of Africa and had
taken part in some strange scenes, but his moral
sense had not been blunted to such an extent that
he could not grieve over some infractions of the
moral law which he observed in peaceful Hanover.
He regretted that he had been led inadvertently
by a young man named Huntington to
join a party which robbed a farmer’s beehive.</p>

<p>“For some unaccountable reason or other,
youth are carried away with false notions of right
and wrong. I know, for instance, that Huntington
possessed those principles of integrity that no
consideration would have induced him to deprive
another of any species of property, except fruit,
bees, pigs, and poultry. And why it is considered
by youth that depriving another of these articles
is less criminal than stealing any other kind of
property, I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>Burroughs himself was inclined to take a
harsher view of these transgressions than he did
of some others; for example, of counterfeiting,
in which he was afterwards for a time engaged
during one of his brief pastorates.</p>

<p>The argument by which his scruples in this particular
were overcome are worth repeating. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
law was indeed violated in its letter, but might
not a justification be found by one who interpreted
it in a large spirit of charity?</p>

<p>“Money is of itself of consequence only as
we annex to it a nominal value as the representation
of property. Therefore we find the only
thing necessary to make a matter valuable is to
induce the world to deem it so; and let that esteem
be raised by any means whatever, yet the
value is the same, and no one becomes injured
by receiving it at the valuation.”</p>

<p>The principle of fiat money having been established,
the only question that remained was
whether the circumstances of the times were such
as to justify him in issuing the fiat. The answer
was in the affirmative. “That an undue scarcity
of cash now prevails is a truth too obvious for
me to attempt to prove. Hence whoever contributes
to increase the quantity of cash does not only
himself but likewise the community an essential
benefit.”</p>

<p>It was in his attempt to benefit the community
in this way that he first experienced the ingratitude
of republics, being landed in the Northampton
jail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>But to see Burroughs at his best one must
enter into his thoughts at that crisis in his life
when he determined that his true vocation was
preaching. He lingers fondly on his emotions
at that period. It was at a time when he had
been driven out of Hanover for conduct which
had outraged the feelings of that long-suffering
community.</p>

<p>“One pistareen was all the ready cash I had on
hand, and the suddenness with which I departed
deprived me of the chance to raise more. Traveling
on leisurely I had time for reflection.”</p>

<p>As was usually the case when he reflected, he
grew more serene and enjoyed a frame of mind
that bordered on the heroic.</p>

<p>“I began to look about me to see what was to
be done in my present situation and to what business
I could turn my attention. The practice of
law, which would have been most to my mind, I
could not undertake until I had spent some time
in the study, which would have been attended
with expense far beyond my abilities; therefore
this object must be laid aside. Physic was under
the same embarrassments; business in the mercantile
line I could not pursue for want of capital.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>... What can be done? There is one thing,
said contrivance, that you can do, and it will answer
your purpose—preach.”</p>

<p>The idea came to him as an inspiration, but
immediately there was suggested an objection
which to a less resourceful mind would have
seemed insuperable. “What an appearance should
I make in my present dress? which consisted of a
light gray coat, with silver-plated buttons, green
vest, and red velvet breeches.”</p>

<p>Down the Connecticut valley he trudged, calling
to mind his father’s old sermons and gradually
working himself into a state of pious rapture. The
heart of no young pulpiteer beat with more appropriate
emotions than his, when on the next Sunday,
under an assumed name, he preached his first
sermon in the village of Ludlow. “I awoke with
anxious palpitation for the issue of the day. I considered
this as the most important scene of my
life—that, in a great measure, my future happiness
or wretchedness depended on my conduct
this day. The time for assembling approached!
I saw the people come together. My feelings
were up in arms against me, my heart would almost
leap into my mouth. What a strange thing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
said I, is man! Why am I thus perturbated by
these whimsical feelings!”</p>

<p>The moment he began the service these perturbations
came to an end. Words came in a
steady flow, and he felt sure that he had found his
true calling in life. “No monarch when seated
on a throne had more sensible feelings of prosperity
than what I experienced at this time.”</p>

<p>The neighboring town of Pelham being without
a minister, Burroughs presented himself as a
candidate, and was enthusiastically accepted. He
made a specialty of funeral sermons, and was soon
in demand in all the surrounding country. It was
at this time also that he became acquainted with
the coiner who showed him how he might surreptitiously
increase the amount of cash in circulation.
All went well till an enemy appeared who called
him by name and revealed his antecedents. All
Pelham was in an uproar, for the Pelhamites were
“a people generally possessing violent passions,
which, once disturbed, raged uncontrolled by the
dictates of reason, unpolished in their manners,
possessing a jealous disposition, and either very
friendly or very inimical, not knowing a medium
between these extremes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>In this case they suddenly became very inimical,
and Burroughs was again compelled to depart
under cover of darkness. His night thoughts
were always among his very best.</p>

<p>“Journeying on, I had time for reflection. At
the dead of night—all alone—reflection would
have its operation. A very singular scene have I
now passed through, said I, and to what does it
amount? Have I acted with propriety as a man,
or have I deviated from the path of rectitude? I
have had an unheard-of, disagreeable part to act;
I do not feel entirely satisfied with myself in this
business, and yet I do not know how I could have
done otherwise, and have made the matter better.
My situation has been such that I have violated
the principle of veracity which we implicitly
pledge ourselves to maintain towards each other,
as a general thing, in society. Whether my peculiar
circumstances would warrant such a line of
procedure is the question. I know many things
will be said in favor of it as well as against it.”</p>

<p>From this difficult question of casuistry he
found relief in reverting to the one instance in
which he had been clearly wrong, viz., joining
the young men in Hanover in their raid on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
farmer’s beehive. “My giving countenance to an
open breach of the laws of the land in the case of
the bees was a matter in which I was justly reprehensible;
but that matter is now past. I must
take things as they are, and under these circumstances
do the best I can. I know the world will
blame me, but I wish to justify my conduct to
myself, let the world think what it may.”</p>

<p>In this endeavor he was highly successful; and
as he walked on, his spirits rose. He contrasted
his own clear views with the muddled ideas of
his late parishioners. “They understand the matter
in the gross, that I have preached under a
fictitious name and character, and consequently
have roused many ideas in the minds of the
people not founded on fact. Therefore they concluded
from this general view the whole to be
founded on wrong. The name impostor is therefore
easily fixed on my character. An impostor,
we generally conceive, puts on feigned appearances
in order to enrich or aggrandize himself to
the damage of others. That this is not the case
with me in this transaction, I think is clear. That
I have aimed at nothing but the bare necessaries
of life, is a fact.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>Having thus cleared himself of the charge of
imposture, he determined to rest his case on the
broad ground of religious liberty. “That I have
a good and equitable right to preach, if I choose
and others choose to hear me, is a truth of which
I entertain no doubt.”</p>

<p>When he was pursued into the borders of the
town of Rutland, it was too much for his patience.
“I turned and ran about twenty rods down a
small hill, and the Pelhamites all after me, hallooing
with all their might, ‘Stop him! stop him!’
To be pursued like a thief, an object of universal
speculation to the inhabitants of Rutland, gave me
very disagreeable sensations, which I determined
not to bear. I therefore stopped, took up a stone,
and declared that the first who should approach
me I would kill on the spot. To hear such language
and to see such a state of determined defiance
in one whom they had lately reverenced
as a clergyman struck even the people of Pelham
with astonishment and fear.”</p>

<p>By the way, there follows a scene which makes
us suspect that parts of Massachusetts in the good
old days may have had a touch of “the wild
West.” The two deacons who were leaders of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
mob drew attention to the fact that besides having
come to them under false pretenses Burroughs
had absconded with five dollars that had been advanced
on his salary. He owed them one sermon
which was theirs of right. In the present excited
state of public opinion it was obviously impossible
for Burroughs to deliver the sermon, but it
was suggested that he might give an equivalent.
A peacemaker intervened, saying, “Wood
keeps an excellent tavern hard by; I propose
for all to move up there.” This proposal was
accepted by all. “I therefore came down, and we
all went up towards the tavern. I called for drink,
according to the orator’s advice, to the satisfaction
of all.”</p>

<p>After that the career of Burroughs went on
from bad to worse, but never was he without the
inner consolations that belong to those who are
misunderstood by the world. Even when he unsuccessfully
sought to set fire to the jail he was
full of fine sentiments borrowed from Young’s
“Night Thoughts.” He quotes the whole passage
beginning</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Night, sable goddess! from her ebon throne.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>This he seems to consider to be in some way a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
justification for his action. He is ever of the
opinion that a man’s heart can not be wrong so
long as he is able to quote poetry.</p>

<p>The various incarcerations to which he was
subjected might only have imbittered a less magnanimous
mind. They rather instilled into Burroughs
a missionary spirit. He felt that he ought
to take more pains to enlighten the ignorance of
the world in regard to his excellent qualities. “I
have many times lamented my want of patient
perseverance in endeavoring to convince my persecutors
of their wrong by the cool dictates of
reason. Error once seen ought to be corrected.
The pruning hook should never be laid aside;
then we should live up to the condition of our
nature, which requires a state of improving and
progressing in knowledge till time shall cease.”</p>

<p>But even Burroughs was human. It is easier
to bear great misfortunes than to meet the petty
annoyances of every-day life. To one who plans
his life in such a way as to depend largely on the
casual gifts of strangers, their dilatoriness is often
a cause of real anxiety.</p>

<p>Here is a painful incident which happened to
him in Philadelphia. He applied to a member of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
Congress for a small sum of money. The gentleman
was not all that he should have been. “The
most striking features of his character were his
great fondness for close metaphysical reasoning
and a habit of great economy in his domestic
concerns, and he had so long practiced upon this
system that any variation from it in a person’s
conduct or any want of success in a person’s
undertakings were, in his view, perfectly wrong.
This was the man to whom I applied as my ultimatum.”</p>

<p>We can see at a glance that such a man was
likely to be disappointing.</p>

<p>“I described my circumstances to him in as clear
terms as possible, and afterwards told him of the
request I wished to make. Without giving me an
answer either in the affirmative or the negative,
he went on with a lengthy discourse to prove that
my system of economy had been wrong, drawing
a comparison between his prosperity and my adversity,
and then pointed out a certain line of conduct
that I ought then to take up and observe,
and offered to assist me in prosecuting such; but
as his plan had many things in it which I could
not reconcile my mind to, I took the liberty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
reasoning with him upon a better plan which I
had marked out in my own mind.”</p>

<p>Upon this, the congressman became obstinate
and would do nothing. His depravity came to
Burroughs as a sudden shock.</p>

<p>“When I took a view of the world, of the pomp
and splendor which surrounded crowds which
perpetually passed before my eyes, to see them
roll in affluence and luxury, inhabiting lofty
houses, with superb equipages, and feasting upon
all the delicacies of life, under these affluent circumstances
withholding from me what would
never have been missed from their superfluity,
this brought to my mind a train of ideas that were
desperate and horrid.... My eyes lighted up
with indignation, my countenance was fortified
with despair, my heart was swollen to that bigness
which was almost too large for my breast to contain.
Under this situation I arose with a tranquil
horror, composedly took my hat, and politely bid
Mr. Niles farewell. I believe the desperate emotions
of my heart were apparently manifested to
his view by my countenance; his apparent immovability
relaxed, he put his hand in his pocket,
and handed me three dollars. This act of kindness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
in a moment melted the ferocious feelings of
my heart, all those desperate sensations vanished,
and I found myself a man.”</p>

<p>Dear reader, have you not often taken a part
in such a scene? When instead of handing out
your dollars at once you conditioned them upon
adherence to some “line of conduct,”—your conscience
accuses you that you might have pointed
even to the buck-saw,—do you realize what a
pitiful spectacle you made of yourself?</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Stephen Burroughs does not at all fulfill our
preconceived notion of an habitual criminal. He
did not love evil for its own sake. His crimes
were incidental, and he mentions them only as the
unfortunate results of circumstances beyond his
own control. His life was rather spent in the contemplation
of virtue. There were some virtues
which came easy to him, and he made the most
of them. Like an expert prestidigitator, he kept
the attention fixed on what was irrelevant, so that
what was really going on passed unnoticed. He
had eliminated personal responsibility from his
scheme of things, and then proceeded as if nothing
were lacking. He had one invariable measure for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
right and wrong. That was right which ministered
to his own peace of body and of mind; that
was wrong which did otherwise.</p>

<p>We are coming to see that that imperturbable
egotism is the characteristic of the “criminal
mind” that is least susceptible to treatment. Sins
of passion are often repented of as soon as they
are committed. Sins of ignorance are cured by
letting in the light. Sins of weakness yield to an
improved environment. But what are you going
to do with the man who is incapable of seeing
that he is in the wrong? Treat him with compassion,
and he accepts the kindness as a tribute
to his own merits; attempt to punish him, and he
is a martyr; reason with him, and his controversial
ardor is aroused in defense of his favorite thesis.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lover of humanity, after he has
tried everything which he can think of to make
an impression on such a character and to bring
him to a realizing sense of social responsibility,
becomes utterly discouraged. He feels tempted
to give up trying any longer. In this he is wrong.
He should not allow himself to be discouraged.
Something must be done, even though nobody
knows what it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>But if the lover of humanity <i>should</i> give up for
a time and take a rest by turning his attention to
a more hopeful case, I should not be too hard on
him. My Pardoner, I am sure, must have some
indulgence for such a weakness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c10">A MAN UNDER ENCHANTMENT</h2>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="decoration">
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap1">I</span> SAT down by the wayside of life like a
man under enchantment.” So Nathaniel Hawthorne
wrote of his own visionary youth, and,
truth to tell, the spell lasted through life.</p>

<p>The wayside itself was not conducive to dreams.
It was a busy thoroughfare. Eager traffickers jostled
one another, and there was much crying up
of new wares. Many important personages went
noisily along. There was a fresh interest in all sorts
of good works and many improvements on the
roadway. There were not many priests or Levites
passing by on the other side, for ecclesiasticism was
not in fashion, but there were multitudes of Good
Samaritans, each one intent on his own brand-new
device for universal helpfulness. There were so
many of them that the poor man who fell among
philanthropists often sighed for the tender mercies
of the thieves. The thieves, at least, when they
had done their work would let him alone. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
time to time there would come groups of eager
reformers, advance agents of the millennium. At
last there came down the road troops hurrying
to the front, and there was the distant sound of
battle.</p>

<p>It was a stirring time, the noon of the nineteenth
century; and the stir was nowhere more
felt than in New England. It was a ferment of
speculation, a whirl of passion, a time of great
aspiration and of no mean achievement.</p>

<p>But if you would get a sense of all this, do not
turn to the pages of Nathaniel Hawthorne. The
ardor of Transcendentalism, the new spirit of
reform, the war between the States,—these were
noted, but they made no very vivid impression on
the man who sat under enchantment. There was
an interval between these happenings and his
consciousness that made them seem scarcely contemporaneous.</p>

<p>It is a fashion in literary criticism to explain
an author by his environment. With Hawthorne
this method is not successful. It is not that his
environment was not interesting in itself. His
genius was essentially aloof. It was a plant that
drew its nourishment from the air rather than from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
the soil. There are some men who have the happy
faculty of making themselves at home wherever
they happen to be. Hawthorne, wherever he had
been born, would have looked upon the scene
with something of a stranger’s eye. Indeed, when
we think about it, the wonder is that most of us
are able to take the world in such a matter-of-fact
way. One would suppose that we had always been
here, instead of being transient guests who cannot
even engage our rooms a day in advance.</p>

<p>It is perhaps a happy limitation which makes
us to forget our slight tenure, and to feel an absolute
ownership in the present moment. We are
satisfied with the passing experience because it
appears to us as permanent.</p>

<p>To the man who sat by the wayside the present
moment did not stand in the sunshine sufficient
unto itself. It did not appear, as it did to the man
of affairs, an ultimate and satisfying reality. He
was not unobservant. He saw the persons passing
by. But each one, in the present moment, seemed
but a fugitive escaping from the past into the
future. Futile flight! unavailing freedom! for in
the Future the Past stands waiting for it. As he
looked at each successive action it was as one who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
watches the moving shadow of an old deed, which
now for some creature has become doom.</p>

<p>Did I say that Hawthorne was little influenced
by his environment? It would be truer to say
that the environment to which he responded was
that to which most men are so strangely oblivious.
He felt what another Salem mystic has expressed:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Around us ever lies the enchanted land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In marvels rich to thine own sons displayed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The true-born Yankee has always persisted, in
spite of the purists, in using “I guess” as equivalent
to “I think.” To his shrewd good-humored
curiosity, all thinking resolves itself into a kind
of guesswork; and one man has as good a right
to his guess as another.</p>

<p>It is a far cry from the talk of the village store
to Emerson and Hawthorne, but to these New
Englanders thinking was still a kind of guessing.
The observer looks at the outward show of things,
which has such an air of finality, and says, “I
guess there’s something behind all this. I guess
it’s worth while to look into it.”</p>

<p>Such a mind is not deterred by the warnings
of formal logic that there is “no thoroughfare.”
When it leaves the public road and sees the sign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
“Private way, dangerous passing,” it says, “that
looks interesting. I guess I’ll take that.”</p>

<p>And from our streets and shops and newspapers,
from our laboratories and lecture rooms
and bureaus of statistics, it is, after all, such a
little way to the border-land of mystery, where all
minds are on an equality and where the wisest
can but dimly guess the riddles that are propounded.</p>

<p>Hawthorne belonged to no school or party.
To the men of his generation he was like the
minister of whom he writes who preached with
a veil over his face.</p>

<p>Nor is his relation in thought to his ancestry
more intimate than that to his contemporaries.
Born to the family of New England Puritanism,
we think we recognize the family likeness—and
yet we are not quite sure. There are traits that
suggest a spiritual changeling.</p>

<p>When we enter into the realm of Hawthorne’s
imagination we are conscious of sombre realities.</p>

<p>Is not this a survival of the puritanic spirit,
with its brooding mysticism, its retributive predestination,
its sense of the judgment to come?
It was said of Carlyle that he was a Calvinist who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
had lost his creed. May not the same be said of
Hawthorne? The old New England theology
had in him become attenuated to a mere film, but
through it all may we not see the old New England
conscience?</p>

<p>Doubtless there is much of this transmitted
influence. Hawthorne himself insisted upon it.
Speaking of “the stern and black-browed Puritan
ancestors,” he said, “Let them scorn me as they
will, strong traits of their nature have intertwined
themselves with mine.”</p>

<p>But it is possible to exaggerate such likenesses.
In Hawthorne’s case there is danger of argument
in a circle. We say that there is something in
Hawthorne’s imagination, in its sombre mysticism,
in its brooding sense of destiny, which is
like that of the spirit of the inhabitants of Salem
and Boston in the old days when they walked
through the narrow streets and through the shadowy
woodland ways pondering the fatal sequences
of life.</p>

<p>But how do we see these old Puritans? We
see them through Hawthorne’s eyes. His imagination
peoples for us the old houses. Was Hawthorne’s
genius tinged with Puritanism, or are our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
conceptions of the Puritan character largely Hawthornesque?
It is not necessary to argue this
matter; it might be better to answer “Yes” to
both questions.</p>

<p>It is the privilege of a creative genius to imprint
his own features upon his forbears. It is difficult
here to determine which is cause and which
is effect. How marvelously Rembrandt gets the
spirit of the Dutch Burgomeisters! It was fortunate
for him that he had such subjects,—stalwart
men with faces that caught the light so
marvelously. Yes, but had it not been for
Rembrandt, who would have told us that these
Dutch gentlemen were so picturesque?</p>

<p>The subject of a good artist is accurately figured;
the subject of a great artist is transfigured.
We cannot separate the historic reality from the
transfiguring light.</p>

<p>But however Hawthorne may have been influenced
by his Puritan inheritance, it would be hard
to find one whose habitual point of view was further
removed from what we are accustomed to
call the “New England conscience.” It is the
characteristic of that type of conscience that it
has an ever-present and sometimes oppressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
sense of personal responsibility. It is militant
and practical rather than mystical. To it evil is
not something to be endured but something to be
resisted. If there is a wrong it must be righted,
and with as little delay as possible.</p>

<p>The highest praise a Puritan could give his
pastor was that he was “a painful preacher.”
Jonathan Mitchell, writing of the beginnings of
the church in Cambridge, says that the people
of Cambridge “were a gracious, savory-spirited
people, principled by Mr. Sheperd, liking an
humbling, heart-breaking ministry and spirit.”</p>

<p>The Puritan theology was based on predestination,
but the Puritan temper was not fatalistic.
When that latter-day Puritan, Lyman Beecher,
was expounding the doctrines of the divine decrees,
one of his sons asked him, “Father, what
if we are decreed to be lost?” The answer was,
“Fight the decrees, my boy!”</p>

<p>The Calvinistic spirit was exactly opposite to
the fatalistic acquiescence which shifts the responsibility
from the creature to the Creator. To be
sure the fall of man took place a long time ago,
but we cannot say that it was none of our business.
It was not an hereditary misfortune to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
borne with fortitude; it was to be assumed as our
personal guilt. “Original sin” means real sin.
Adam sinned as the typical and representative
man, and every man became a sinner. No individual
could plead an <i>alibi</i>. The “conviction of
sin” was not the acquiescence in a penalty,—it
was the heartbreaking consciousness of the “exceeding
sinfulness of sin.”</p>

<p>“In Adam’s fall <i>we</i> sinned all.” When they
said that, they were thinking not of Adam, but of
themselves. <i>They</i> did it; it was the guilt that was
imputed to them. Sensitive consciences were tortured
in the attempt fully to realize their guilt.</p>

<p>The real inheritors of this type of conscience
were to be found among many of the radical
reformers and agitators who were Hawthorne’s
contemporaries and with whom he had little in
common. When their formal creed had fallen
off, there remained the sense of personal guilt for
original sin. The sin of the nation and of the
whole social order weighed heavily upon them
and tortured them, and they found relief only in
action.</p>

<p>All this was foreign to Hawthorne’s mind. In
his treatment of sin there is always a sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
moral detachment. We are not made to see, as
George Eliot makes us see, the struggle with temptation,—the
soul, like a wild thing, seeing the
tempting bait and drawing nearer to the trap.
Hawthorne begins after the deed is done. He
shows us the</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">wild thing taken in a trap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which sees the trapper coming thro’ the wood.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Of what is the trap made? It is made of a deed
already done. Whence comes the ghostly trapper?
He is no stranger in the wood. There is no staying
his advance as he makes his fatal rounds.</p>

<p>In the preface to the “House of the Seven
Gables” the author gives the argument of the
story,—“the truth, namely, that the wrong-doing
of one generation lives into the successive ones,
and, divesting itself of every temporary advantage,
becomes a pure and uncontrollable mischief.”</p>

<p>This is the theme of the Greek tragedy—Nemesis.
The deed is done and cannot be undone;
the inevitable consequences must be endured.</p>

<p>In the “Scarlet Letter,” when Hester and Roger
Chillingworth review the past and peer into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
future, Hester says, “I said but now that there
can be no good event for him or thee or me who
are wandering together in this gloomy maze of
evil, and stumbling at every step over the guilt
wherewith we have strewn our path.”</p>

<p>But is the present stumbling guilt or is it
merely misery? The old man replies, “By the
first slip awry thou didst plant the germ of evil,
but since that moment it has been a dark necessity.
Ye that have wronged me are not sinful,
save in a kind of typical illusion, neither am I
fiend-like who have snatched a fiend’s office from
his hands. It is our fate. Let the black flower
blossom as it may.”</p>

<p>Strange words to come from one who had sat
in a Puritan meeting-house! It is such comment
as the Greek Chorus might make watching the
unfolding of the doom of the house of Agamemnon.
And when the tale of the “Scarlet Letter”
has been told, how does the author himself look
upon it? How does he distribute praise and
blame?</p>

<p>“To all these shadowy beings so long our near
acquaintances—as well Roger Chillingworth as
his companions—we would fain be merciful. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
is a curious subject of observation and inquiry
whether love and hatred be not the same thing at
bottom. Each in its utmost development supposes
a high degree of intimacy and heart-knowledge;
each renders one individual dependent for
his spiritual life on another; each leaves the passionate
lover or the no less passionate hater forlorn
and desolate by the withdrawal of its subject.
Philosophically considered, therefore, the passions
seem essentially the same except that one happens
to be seen in celestial radiance and the other in a
dusky lurid glow.” This is not the Puritan Conscience
uttering itself. It is an illusive and questioning
spirit.</p>

<p>If in his attitude toward human destiny Hawthorne
was in some essential respects un-Puritan,
so also was he un-modern. There is a characteristic
difference between antique and modern symbols
for those necessary processes, beyond the
sphere of our own wills, by which our lives are
determined. The ancients pictured it with austere
simplicity. Life is a simple thread. The Fates
spin it. It is drawn out on the distaff and cut
off by the fatal shears.</p>

<p>Compare this with the phrase Carlyle loved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
quote, “the roaring loom of Time.” Life is not a
spinning-wheel, but a loom. A million shuttles
fly; a million threads are inextricably interwoven.
You cannot long trace the single thread; you
can discern only the growing pattern. There is
inevitable causation, but it is not simple but complex.
The situation at the present moment is the
result not of one cause but of innumerable causes,
and it is in turn the cause of results that are
equally incalculable. We are a part of</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1">the web of being blindly wove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By man and beast and air and sea.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Men of science show us how the whole acts upon
each part and each part acts upon the whole.
Modern novelists attempt, not always successfully,
to give the impression of the amazing complexity
of actual life, where all sorts of things are
going on at the same time.</p>

<p>Whether we look upon it as his limitation or
as his good fortune, Hawthorne adhered to the
spinning-wheel rather than the loom. We see the
antique Fates drawing out the thread. A long
series of events follow one another from a single
cause.</p>

<p>A part of the power of Hawthorne over our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
imagination lies in his singleness of purpose. In
“The Marble Faun” we are told, “The stream of
Miriam’s trouble kept its way through this flood
of human life, and neither mingled with it nor
was turned aside.”</p>

<p>We are made to see the dark streams that do
not mingle nor turn aside, and we watch their
fatal flow.</p>

<p>But is this real, normal life? In such life do
not the streams mingle? Are not evil influences
quickly neutralized, as noxious germs die in the
sunshine? No one would more readily acknowledge
this than Hawthorne. He says: “It is not,
I apprehend, a healthy kind of mental occupation
to devote ourselves too exclusively to the study
of individual men and women. If the person
under examination be one’s self, the result is
pretty certain to be diseased action of the heart
almost before we can snatch a second glance. Or
if we take the freedom to put a friend under the
microscope, we thereby insulate him from many
of his true relations, magnify his peculiarities, inevitably
tear him into parts, and of course patch
him clumsily together again. What wonder, then,
that we be frightened at such a monster, which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
after all—though we can point to every feature
of his deformity in the real personage—may be
said to have been created mainly by ourselves.”</p>

<p>The critic of Hawthorne could not describe
better the limitation of his stories as pictures
of real life. His characters, however clearly conceived,
are insulated from many of their real relations,
and their peculiarities are magnified.</p>

<p>In the preface to “The Scarlet Letter” he says
that the tale “wears to my eye a stern and sombre
aspect, too much ungladdened by the tender and
familiar influences which soften almost every
scene of Nature and real life, and which undoubtedly
should soften every picture of them.”</p>

<p>One who would defend Hawthorne the Author
against Hawthorne the Critic must point out the
kind of literature to which his work belongs.
When we judge it by the rule of the romance or
of the realistic novel, we fail to do justice to its
essential quality. The romancer, the story-teller
pure and simple, is attracted by the swift sequence
of events. His nimble fancy follows a plot as a
kitten follows a string. Now it happens that in a
world constituted as ours is the sequence of events
follows a moral order. A good story has always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
in it an element of poetic justice. But the romancer
does not tell his story for the sake of the
moral. He professes to be as much surprised
when it is discovered as is the most innocent
reader. In like manner the realistic novel, in proportion
as it is a faithful portrayal of life, has an
ethical lesson. But the writer disclaims any purpose
of teaching it. His business is to tell what
the world is like. He leaves the rest to your intelligence.</p>

<p>But there is another kind of literature; it is
essentially allegory. The allegorist takes a naked
truth and clothes it with the garments of the imagination.
Frequently the clothes do not fit and
the poor truth wanders about awkwardly, self-conscious
to the last degree. But if the artist be
a genius the abstract thought becomes a person.</p>

<p>Hawthorne’s work is something more than allegory,
but his mind worked allegorically. His
characters were abstract before they became concrete.
He was not a realist aiming to give a comprehensive
survey of the actual world. He consciously
selected the incidents and scenes which
would illustrate his theme.</p>

<p>In his conclusion of “The Marble Faun,” when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
the actors have withdrawn, the Author comes
before the curtain and says that he designed “the
story and the characters to bear, of course, a certain
relation to human nature and human life, but
still to be so artfully and airily removed from our
mundane sphere that some laws and proprieties
of their own should be implicitly and insensibly
acknowledged. The idea of the modern Faun, for
example, loses all the poetry and beauty which the
Author fancied in it and becomes nothing better
than a grotesque absurdity if we bring it into the
actual light of day.” This is not realism.</p>

<p>It is a mood in which the bounds between romance
and allegory fade away; persons become
symbols and symbols have breathed into them the
breath of life. The story and the truth it shadows
are one.</p>

<p>The mood is common in poetry. Poets like
Dante and Spenser and Shelley from it have given
us</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent9">Wise and lovely songs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fate and God and chance and chaos old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And love.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>There is a point where “dreams begin to feel
the truth and stir of day,” where the incidents of
existence assume a dream-like character, and where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
dreams become transparent symbols of reality.
There are moods in which our familiar world
seems strange to us, and we walk in it as on some
bewildered shore.</p>

<p>In such moods to meet Hawthorne is a great
experience. He is no longer shy and aloof, but
he opens to us his heart, and with friendly zeal
points out each object of interest—for in this
border-land he is at home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c11">THE CRUELTY OF GOOD PEOPLE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE cruelty of bad people is easily explained.
They are cruel because they enjoy watching
the pain of others. There are also the ignorant
and half-formed, to whom the word “inhumanity”
applies literally. They have not yet been
really humanized. Before they can habitually yield
to feelings of compassion there is much to be done
in developing their higher natures. They must be
urged to</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Move upward, working out the beast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let the ape and tiger die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The beast has a long start, and the ape and tiger
die hard.</p>

<p>But this is only half the story. We are continually
surprised at the cruelty that is possible in
those in whom there seems to be no tigerish survival.
It is intimately associated with the higher
rather than with the lower part of the nature. It
is spiritual, rational, and moral. The cruelty of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
women and priests is proverbial—and they are
good women and good priests.</p>

<p>Listen to the talk in a drawing-room when some
question involving the fate of thousands is introduced.
There is a strike or lock-out. It means that
the hostile parties are struggling on a narrow ledge
between two precipices. The workmen are trying
to push the employers into the abyss of bankruptcy;
the employers are exerting every means
in their power to hurl their antagonists into the
abyss of starvation. It is a battle to the death, and
in many a home pale-faced women are watching
it with despairing eyes. But what says my lady
who likes to talk about current events? It is
evident when she begins to speak that she is not
touched by the tragedy of it all. Nero watching
the burning of Rome could not assume an air of
more complete detachment. She talks as if it were
nothing to her. Or the talk turns to the affairs of
state. Issues that involve the fate of nations awake
in her only a languid curiosity. The diplomacy
of prudent statesmen who are endeavoring to
keep the peace strikes her as mere dilly-dallying.
She wants to see something doing. She enjoys a
romantic sensation, and urges on those who would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
give her this pleasure. Was there ever a useless
war without fair faces looking down upon it approvingly—at
least at the beginning?</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Yet she who in regard to the great affairs which
involve millions may appear as “La Belle Dame
sans Merci” may be to all those whom she knows
a minister of purest kindness. It is only towards
those whom she does not know that she is pitiless.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>Philosophers are usually cruel in their judgments
of the persons and events of the passing
day, and that is perhaps the reason why no nation
has been willing to take the hint from Plato and
allow the philosophers to rule. It would be too
harsh a despotism. Flesh and blood could not
endure it. For the philosopher is concerned with
general laws and is intolerant of exceptions,
while it is the quality of mercy to treat each person
as in some degree an exception. Fancy the
misery that would be involved in the attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
level us all up to the cold heights of abstract
virtue on which Spinoza dwelt. One shudders
to think of the calamity that would ensue were
all our lawmakers to be suddenly Hegelianized.
All the attempts to alleviate the hard conditions
under which people are living would cease. The
energy that is now spent in trying to abolish
abuses would then be directed toward explaining
them. What wailings would go up from earth’s
millions on the proclamation of the rule of unlimited
Spencerianism! We should look back
with envy to the good old times of Nero and
Tamerlane.</p>

<p>As the Inquisition handed its victims over to the
secular arm and disclaimed all further responsibility,
so this new tyrant would hand over all the
unfit to the unobstructed working of natural
law. No attention would be paid to our sentimental
preferences for particular persons. Those
merciful interferences which have been the contrivance
of mankind for the protection of weakness
must be swept aside. The unfit must take
the full penalty justly visited on their unfitness.
The moment we begin to particularize we rebel.
Pity revolts against a too cold philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>It is needless to say that the theologians have
often attained refinements of cruelty unknown
even to the most severely logical of the secular
philosophers. They have been able to distill out
of the purest religious affections a poison capable
of producing in the sensitive soul unutterable
agony. Then they have watched the writhing of
the victim with a cold benevolence. The worst
of it was that the benevolence was real in spite
of the fact that it froze all the fountains of
natural pity.</p>

<p>Jonathan Edwards was not merely a good man
in the ordinary sense. His goodness rose into ideal
heights. He had a genius for ethics as well as for
religion. He is still a teacher of teachers. But
this wonderful man, who must ever have a high
place among the leaders and inspirers of mankind,
has an equally high place among the torturers of
the spirit. To understand the kind of pain which
he inflicted we must not be content with the
threatenings of torment in sermons like that on
“Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.” The
pictorial imagery which now startles us was
common enough in his day. The torments of
sinners was an ordinary theme; Edwards added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
appreciably to the torments of the saints. His
vivisection of the human soul was without compunction.
In the hearts and desires of the innocent
he discovered guilt for which there was no
pardon. Every resting-place for natural human
affection was torn away, and when at last from
the clear heaven the love of God shone down in
dazzling splendor, it shone upon a desert.</p>

<p>The cruelty of it all is seen in its effects on
minds naturally prone to melancholy. Read the
journal of a disciple of Edwards, David Brainerd,
and remember that for several generations that
journal was esteemed a proper book to put into
the hands of youth. The editor of the Journal
says, “As an example of a mind tremulously apprehensive
of sin, loathing it in every form and
for its own sake, avoiding even the appearance
of evil, rising above all terrestrial considerations,
advancing rapidly in holiness, and finding its only
enjoyment in the glory of God, probably no similar
work in any language can furnish a parallel.”
Poor Brainerd! Every step along the heavenly
way cost him a pang. He never could forget for
more than a few hours at a time that he was human,
and to be human was to be vile. The groans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
follow one another with monotonous iteration.
He loved God, but he felt his guilt in not loving
him more. He was not only afraid of hell, but
of a heaven of which he was unworthy.</p>

<p>“I seem to be declining with respect to my
life and warmth in divine things. I deserve hell
every day for not loving my Lord more.... I
saw myself very mean and vile, and wondered at
those who showed me respect.”</p>

<p>We all feel that way sometimes, but to have
the feelings set down day by day for years at a
time seems hardly profitable. We are relieved
when occasionally the editor summarizes the spiritual
conflicts of a week or two without going
into details, as in the latter part of December,
1744. “The next twelve days he was for the
most part extremely dejected, discouraged and
distressed, and was evidently much under the
power of melancholy. There are from day to day
most bitter complaints of exceeding vileness,
ignorance, and corruption; an amazing load of
guilt, unworthiness even to creep on God’s earth,
everlasting uselessness, fitness for nothing, etc., and
sometimes expressions even of horror at the
thoughts of ever preaching again. But yet in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
time of dejection he speaks of several intervals
of divine help and comfort.”</p>

<p>The pitiful thing about it all was that Brainerd’s
distress arose not from the consciousness of any
particular shortcoming of his own, which after
all was finite. He was endeavoring to realize the
meaning of that infinite guilt which was his as
a child of Adam. That guilt must be infinite
because it was a sin against infinite purity and
power. When he had repented to the very utmost
of his ability, he was conscious that he had
not repented enough.</p>

<p>When he went to New Jersey as a missionary
to the Indians, it was this abnormal spiritual sensitiveness
which he endeavored to impart to the
aboriginal mind.</p>

<p>He found it difficult to bring the Indians to that
degree of spiritual anguish which, in his view,
was necessary to their salvation. He could make
them understand the meaning of actual transgression,
but they were dull of comprehension when
he urged them to repent of original sin.</p>

<p>“Another difficulty,” he says, “which I am
now upon, is that it is next to impossible to bring
them to a rational conviction that they are sinners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
by nature, and that their hearts are corrupt
and sinful, unless one can charge them with some
gross act of immorality such as the <i>light of nature</i>
condemns.”</p>

<p>One would suppose that the missionary might
have found among his untutored Indians enough
actual transgressions to have brought to them a
conviction of sin and a desire for a better life.
But no, that was not enough, it would have fallen
far short of what he had in mind. It would have
only convinced them that they were sinners individually
considered, and would not have overwhelmed
them with the guilt of the race. So
he hit upon a device to turn their minds from
the incidental trangressions of mature life to the
central fact that depravity was innate and universal.</p>

<p>“The method which I take to convince them
that we are sinners by nature is to lead them to
an observation of their little children: how they
will appear in a rage, fight and strike their mothers
before they are able to speak or walk, while they
are so young that they are incapable of learning
such practices.... As children have never learned
these things, they must have been in their natures;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
and consequently they must be allowed to be by
nature the children of wrath.”</p>

<p>It did not seem to occur to Brainerd that in
thus setting the child in the midst of them as an
illustration of the kingdom of wrath he was not
imitating the method of Jesus. Even in his treatment
of the sins of later life there is something
illustrative of the cruel system which dominated
him.</p>

<p>“I then mention all the vices I know the Indians
to be guilty of, and so make use of these
sinful <i>streams</i> to convince them that the <i>fountain</i>
is corrupt. This is the end for which I mention
their wicked practices to them; not because I
expect to bring them to an effectual reformation
merely by inveighing against their immoralities,
but hoping that they may hereby be convinced
of the corruption of their hearts, and awakened
to a sense of the depravity and misery of their
fallen state.”</p>

<p>Brainerd had in mind a profound truth; every
great moral awakening is accompanied by pain.
But he was not content with that which comes
naturally. All specific reformation in morals and
manners was subordinated to that which he conceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
to be the essential thing,—that they should
feel to its full extent the misery of being human.</p>

<p class="gtb">******</p>

<p>In every readjustment of thought or advance
in the manner of life there is involved a vast
amount of unescapable pain. There is also a
great deal of pain that is gratuitously inflicted.
In the contest between the forces of conservatism
and progress it is difficult to say which side is
more open to the charge of cruelty.</p>

<p>In reading history our sympathies are usually
with the bold innovator. He stands alone against
the world and proclaims an unpopular truth. He
is misunderstood, reviled, persecuted for righteousness’
sake. The defenders of the old order
are hard-hearted persecutors who hound him to
death.</p>

<p>But this is only half the story. A glimpse of
the other side is given in the very term we use.
We speak of the <i>defenders</i> of the old order. We
only understand their feelings when we remember
that they were really on the defensive. The
things they held most sacred were attacked by a
ruthless power which they could not understand.
They flew to the rescue of sanctuaries about to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
be violated. They often fought as those in mortal
agony, using blindly such weapons as came to
their hands.</p>

<p>In “The Faerie Queene” Una, the fair symbol
of Truth, wanders through the forest protected
by her lion. He is a good lion and faithful
to his lady.</p>

<p>But it was a losing battle. The lion’s sudden
fierceness was all in vain.</p>

<p>The lover of the old order does not stop to ask
whether the lion may not have made a mistake,
and whether the object of his attack may not
have been, instead of a proud Paynim, only a
Christian knight who had approached to ask his
way. Nor does he feel pity for the pains inflicted
by the lion’s “sharp rending clawes.” He only
cries, “Poor lion! Poor Lady Truth!”</p>

<p>“But,” says the careful reader, “are you not
getting away from your subject? You proposed
the question, ‘Why are good people so cruel?’
You began with the conversation of excellent
ladies in the drawing-room, and now you have
wandered off into faery land, and are talking
about the Lady Truth and the noble lion who
died in her defense. I fear you are losing your
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>On the contrary, dear reader, I think, as the
children say when they are hunting the thimble,
we are “getting warm.” We started out to find
a cause for the obliviousness of good people to
the pain which they inflict on others, and we have
come into the region of allegory. Now, one of
the chief reasons why good people are cruel is
that it is so easy for them to allegorize.</p>

<p>In an allegory virtues and vices are personified.
Each is complete in itself, and when it once has
been set going it follows a preordained course. It
does not grow into something else, and it is incapable
of repentance or improvement. In the
morality plays a virtue is as virtuous and a vice
as vicious at the beginning as at the end. Spenser
prefixes to “The Faerie Queene” a prose explanation
of the meaning of each important character.
“The first of the Knight of the Red-crosse, in
whom I set forth Holynes; the second of Sir
Guyon, in whome I sette forth Temperance; the
third of Britomartis, a lady knight, in whom I
picture Chastity.” Now, after this explanation we
are relieved of all those anxieties which beset us
when we watch creatures of flesh and blood setting
out in the world to try their souls. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
is as much a matter of invariable law as the
reactions of chemical elements. The Knight of
the Red-cross may appear to be tempted, but he
is really immune. He cannot fall from grace.
From that disaster he is protected by the definition.
We have only to learn what the word holiness
means to know what he will do. As for Sir
Guyon, when once we learn that he is Temperance,
we would trust him anywhere. For such
characters there is nothing possible but ultimate
triumph over their foes. And what of their foes?
Being allegorical characters, they cannot be reformed.
There is nothing to do but to kill them
without compunction, or if we can catch them
in the traps which they have set for others, and
make them suffer the torments they have themselves
invented, so much the better. We welcome
the knight—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who slayes the Gyaunt, wounds the Beast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And strips Duessa quight.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>We have no compunctions as we watch the administration
of poetical justice. Whatever happens
to the false Duessa and to such miscreants
as Sansfoy and Sansjoy and Sansloy, we say that
it serves them right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>If we can only hold fast to the allegorical clue,
and be assured that he is dealing with sins and
not with persons, we can follow Dante through
purgatory without flinching. The moral always
is a good one, and full of suggestiveness.</p>

<p>But the moment we mistake an allegorical
character for a person of flesh and blood we
get into trouble. Even the most perfect parable
represents only a certain phase of reality. When
it is forced beyond its real intention and taken
literally it shocks our sense of humanity. It needs
to be interpreted by the same wise spirit that conceived
it. We repeat the story of the symbolic
virgins who had forgotten to put oil in their
lamps, or of the servant who was too timid to put
his master’s money out to usury. The child asks,
“Wasn’t it cruel of those wise virgins not to give
the others just a little of their oil? And after the
door was shut and the foolish virgins knew how
foolish they were and were sorry, couldn’t the
people inside have opened the door just a little
bit? And just because the servant was afraid to
go to the bank with the money, because it was so
little, ought the master to have been so hard with
him as to say, ‘Cast ye the unprofitable servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
into the outer darkness; there shall be weeping
and wailing and gnashing of teeth?’ Why didn’t
he give him another chance?”</p>

<p>Then the parent will explain that these are
symbolic characters. Or perhaps he may not try
to explain, but change the subject and read a
story of real people like that of the prodigal son
or the good Samaritan. The child may be made
to understand that while the door is always shut
against a sin, it is always open for the sinner who
repents.</p>

<p>The sensitive child takes up the “Pilgrim’s Progress”
and reads of the way Christian went on his
way to the heavenly city, meeting all kinds of
people, yet apparently without sympathy for most
of them. “Why did he leave his wife and little
children in the City of Destruction and go off
alone? If he knew that the city was to be burned
up, why didn’t he stay with them? He doesn’t
seem to care very much for what happens to
people who are not of his set.” So it seems to be.
Mr. Hold-the-world, Mr. Money-love, and Mr.
Save-all walk along with him, and then they go
off the path to look into a silver-mine. Christian
doesn’t take the trouble to find out what became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
of them. Bunyan says coolly, “Whether they fell
into the pit by looking over the brink or whether
they went down to dig, or whether they were
smothered by the damps that commonly arise,
of these things I am not certain; but this I observed,
that they were never seen that way again.”
Christian goes on after the tragedy perfectly unconcerned,
singing a cheerful hymn. It was none
of his business what happened to those who
wandered off the road. He is rather pleased than
otherwise when Vain-Confidence falls into the pit.
When “the brisk young lad,” Ignorance, joins
him Christian converses with him only long
enough to find out his name and where he came
from. Then instead of trying to improve him he
leaves him behind. Poor Ignorance trudges after,
but he never can catch up.</p>

<p>All this is right in an allegory. Ignorance must
be left behind, Vain-Confidence must perish in the
pit; from the City of Destruction we must flee
without waiting for others to follow. This is a
very simple lesson in the way of life. The next
lesson is more difficult and it is quite different,—how
to treat ignorant and vainglorious and otherwise
imperfect <i>persons</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>The first thing we have to remember is that
they are persons, and that persons are quite different
from allegorical characters. Persons can
change their minds, they can repent and aspire
after a better life, and above all they have feelings,—which
abstract virtues and vices do not have.
Does not the cruelty of the good chiefly arise
from the fact that they do not see all this?</p>

<p>In a preceding essay we have considered
Hawthorne’s judgment on the characters which
he himself created. His most powerful story of
sin and retribution wears to his eyes “a stern and
sombre aspect too much ungladdened by the
tender and familiar influences which soften almost
every scene of Nature and real life.” He was
aware that he was depicting not all of life, but
only one aspect of it. He saw the characters of
the “Scarlet Letter,” as they saw themselves, “in a
kind of typical illusion.” He was fully aware that
his treatment was symbolic rather than realistic.
Real life is infinitely more complex and therefore
more full of possibilities of good than any symbolic
representation of it.</p>

<p>I do not think that good people are really as
cruel at heart as one would be led to think from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
their words, or even from their acts. I remember
a good professor of theology who was discoursing
on the way in which the Canaanites were destroyed
in order that Israel might possess the land.</p>

<p>“Professor,” asked a literal-minded student,
“why did the Lord create the Canaanites, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“The Lord created the Canaanites,” answered
the professor, “in order that Israel might have
something on which to whet his sword.”</p>

<p>The words were bloodthirsty enough; and yet
had I been a Canaanite in distress I should have
made my way at once to the good professor’s
house. I am sure that the moment he saw me he
would have taken me in and ministered tenderly
to my distresses and protected me from an unkindly
world. But I should have taken the precaution
to let him see me before he learned my
name. A Canaanite in the abstract would be an
abomination to him, and I would have to take
pains to make him understand that I was a human
being.</p>

<p>The word “cruel” is in its derivation akin to
“crude;” it is that which is raw and unripe. Like
all other good things, righteousness at first is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
crude. Crude righteousness takes no account of
the difference between a sinner and his sin; it
hates both alike with a bitter hatred, and visits
on each the same condemnation. It is harsh and
bitter. For all that it is a good thing, this unripe
fruit of righteousness. Give it time and sunshine,
and it will grow sweet and mellow.</p>
